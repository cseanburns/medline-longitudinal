AB  - Both the inflammatory potential and cognitive function decline during aging. The 
      association between the repertoire of inflammatory biomarkers and cognitive
      decline is unclear. Inflammatory cytokines have been reported to be increased,
      decreased, or unchanged in the cerebrospinal fluid and sera of subjects with
      dementia. We assessed 112 postmortem brains from subjects diagnosed with
      poststroke dementia (PSD), vascular dementia, mixed dementia, and Alzheimer's
      disease (AD), comparing those to poststroke nondemented (PSND) subjects and
      age-matched controls. We analyzed 5 brain regions including the gray and white
      matter from the frontal and temporal lobes for a panel of cytokine and/or
      chemokine analytes using multiplex-array assays. Of the 37 analytes, 14 were
      under or near the detection limits, 7 were close to the lowest detection level,
      and 16 cytokines were within the linear range of the assay. We observed widely
      variable concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A at the
      high end (1-150 ng/mg protein), whereas several of the interleukins (IL,
      interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor) at the low end (1-10 pg/mg). There
      were also regional variations; most notable being high concentrations of some
      cytokines (e.g., CRP and angiogenesis panel) in the frontal white matter.
      Overall, we found decreased concentrations of several cytokines, including IL-1
      beta (p = 0.000), IL-6 (p = 0.000), IL-7 (p = 0.000), IL-8 (p = 0.000), IL-16 (p 
      = 0.001), interferon-inducible protein-10 (0.044), serum amyloid A (p = 0.011),
      and a trend in IL-1 alpha (p = 0.084) across all dementia groups compared to
      nondemented controls. IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly lower in dementia subjects
      than in nondemented subjects in every region. In particular, lower levels of IL-6
      and IL-8 were notable in the PSD compared to PSND subjects. Because these 2
      stroke groups had comparable degree of vascular pathology, the lower production
      of IL-6 and IL-8 in PSD reaffirms a possible specific involvement of
      immunosenescence in dementia pathogenesis. In contrast, CRP was not altered
      between dementia and nondementia subjects or between PSD and PSND. Our study
      provides evidence not only for the feasibility of tracking cytokines in
      postmortem brain tissue but also suggests differentially impaired inflammatory
      mechanisms underlying dementia including AD. There was a diminished inflammatory 
      response, possibly reflecting immunosenescence and cerebral atrophy, in all
      dementias. Strategies to enhance anti-inflammatory cytokines and boost the immune
      system of the brain may be beneficial for preventing cognitive dysfunction,
      especially after stroke.

TI  - Beyond Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) and Delirium: A Systematic Review of UTIs and Neuropsychiatric Disorders.
PG  - 402-11
LID - 10.1097/PRA.0000000000000105 [doi]
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections.
      Although comorbid UTI in geriatric patients with delirium or dementia is well
      known, the prevalence and scope of the association with other neuropsychiatric
      disorders is unclear. We performed a systematic review of the association between
      UTIs and delirium, dementia, psychotic disorders, and mood disorders in
      hospitalized patients. We identified studies by searching PubMed, PsycInfo, and
      Web of Knowledge, and the reference lists of identified studies and review
      papers. Seventeen publications met the inclusion criteria. The primary findings
      were: (1) 88% of publications reported a positive association between UTIs and
      neuropsychiatric disorders; (2) 47% reported that the clinical course of a
      neuropsychiatric disorder may be precipitated or exacerbated by a UTI; (3) the
      mean weighted prevalence of UTIs in subjects was 19.4% for delirium, 11.2% for
      dementia, 21.7% for nonaffective psychotic disorders, and 17.8% for mood
      disorders. Our findings, which must be interpreted carefully given the
      heterogeneity among the studies, suggest that UTIs are highly comorbid in
      hospitalized patients and may precipitate or exacerbate some neuropsychiatric
      disorders. The association extends beyond geriatric patients with delirium,
      affects males and females, and includes adults with psychotic and mood disorders.
      These findings underscore the important interface between physical and mental
      health. Potential underlying mechanisms are also reviewed, including complex
      interactions between the immune system and the brain.

TI  - Effects of leisure activities at home on perceived care burden and the endocrine system of caregivers of dementia patients: a randomized controlled study.
PG  - 261-8
LID - 10.1017/S1041610215001295 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychological stress associated with caregiving is thought to
      underlie the high incidence of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and
      mortality, as well as reduced immune function, among caregivers of dementia
      patients. Here, we examined the effects of periodic leisure activities performed 
      by caregivers of dementia patients with care recipients at home on perceived care
      burden and levels of stress hormones. METHODS: Participants were 42 caregivers
      aged >/= 65 years of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia. They were
      randomly assigned to intervention and non-intervention groups. The intervention
      group underwent a leisure activity program (30 min/3 times/week for 24 weeks)
      with the care recipient, and the control group underwent normal care activities. 
      RESULTS: The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) score, a subjective indicator of care
      burden, significantly decreased after intervention in the intervention group (p <
      0.05), whereas no difference was observed in the control group. No significant
      changes were observed in adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and cortisol levels
      in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of changes in stress hormone levels despite
      a decrease in subjective care burden in the intervention group might be explained
      by the effects of the chosen leisure activity on the neuroendocrine system. Our
      findings suggest that periodic leisure activities can reduce perceived care
      burden among caregivers of dementia patients. However, in order to evaluate
      accurately the effects of leisure activities of the present study, long-term
      follow-up of both caregivers and care recipients is necessary. The Nagoya
      University Department of Medicine Ethics Committee Clinical Trials Registry
      Number is 1290.

TI  - Novel drug target identification for the treatment of dementia using multi-relational association mining.
PG  - 11104
LID - 10.1038/srep11104 [doi]
AB  - Dementia is a neurodegenerative condition of the brain in which there is a
      progressive and permanent loss of cognitive and mental performance. Despite the
      fact that the number of people with dementia worldwide is steadily increasing and
      regardless of the advances in the molecular characterization of the disease,
      current medical treatments for dementia are purely symptomatic and hardly
      effective. We present a novel multi-relational association mining method that
      integrates the huge amount of scientific data accumulated in recent years to
      predict potential novel targets for innovative therapeutic treatment of dementia.
      Owing to the ability of processing large volumes of heterogeneous data, our
      method achieves a high performance and predicts numerous drug targets including
      several serine threonine kinase and a G-protein coupled receptor. The predicted
      drug targets are mainly functionally related to metabolism, cell surface receptor
      signaling pathways, immune response, apoptosis, and long-term memory. Among the
      highly represented kinase family and among the G-protein coupled receptors, DLG4 
      (PSD-95), and the bradikynin receptor 2 are highlighted also for their proposed
      role in memory and cognition, as described in previous studies. These novel
      putative targets hold promises for the development of novel therapeutic
      approaches for the treatment of dementia.

TI  - Paraneoplastic Limbic Encephalitis Associated with Adenocarcinoma of Lung.
PG  - 108-12
AB  - PURPOSE: Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE) is a rare, immune-mediated
      entity. We present an unusual case of a patient who has double cancers and two
      different paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old
      gentleman has histories of adenocarcinoma of lung and malignant thymoma
      associated with myasthenia gravis, which underwent surgery and chemotherapy 3
      years ago. This time, he presented to our ward with rapidly progressive memory
      decline and myoclonic jerks in his limbs for two weeks. Magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) of brain showed increased signal intensity over bilateral mesial
      temporal regions on T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recover (FLAIR) series. Chest
      computed tomography showed cancer recurrence. He received steroid pulse therapy
      firstly and right lung lower lobe lobectomy later. Pathology report of the tumor 
      was recurrent adenocarcinoma. After the immunotherapy and tumor resection, his
      mentality improved gradually. Six months later, brain MRI showed resolution of
      bilateral temporal hyperintensity with residual mesial temporal atrophy.
      CONCLUSION: From our case, we would like to emphasize that paraneoplastic limbic 
      encephalitis should be considered among the differential diagnosis of rapidly
      progressive dementia associated with myoclonus, along with other
      neurodegenerative diseases. Depending on its underlying malignancy, the cognitive
      impairment may be substantially reversible, despite atrophy of mesial temporal
      lobes.

TI  - Non-celiac gluten sensitivity triggers gut dysbiosis, neuroinflammation, gut-brain axis dysfunction, and vulnerability for dementia.
PG  - 110-31
AB  - The non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal
      disorder which is very common world wide. The human gut harbors microbiota which 
      has a wide variety of microbial organisms; they are mainly symbiotic and
      important for well being. However, "dysbiosis" - i.e. an alteration in normal
      commensal gut microbiome with an increase in pathogenic microbes, impacts
      homeostasis/health. Dysbiosis in NCGS causes gut inflammation, diarrhea,
      constipation, visceral hypersensitivity, abdominal pain, dysfunctional metabolic 
      state, and peripheral immune and neuro-immune communication. Thus,
      immune-mediated gut and extra-gut dysfunctions, due to gluten sensitivity with
      comorbid diarrhea, may last for decades. A significant proportion of NCGS
      patients may chronically consume alcohol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
      and fatty diet, as well as suffer from various comorbid disorders. The above
      pathophysiological substrate and dysbiosis are underpinned by dysfunctional
      bidirectional "Gut-Brain Axis" pathway. Pathogenic gut microbiota is known to
      upregulate gut- and systemic inflammation (due to lipopolysaccharide from
      pathogenic bacteria and synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines); they enhance
      energy harvest, cause obesity, insulin resistance, and dysfunctional vago-vagal
      gut-brain axis. Conceivably, the above cascade of pathology may promote various
      pathophysiological mechanisms, neuroinflammation, and cognitive dysfunction.
      Hence, dysbiosis, gut inflammation, and chronic dyshomeostasis are of great
      clinical relevance. It is argued here that we need to be aware of NCGS and its
      chronic pathophysiological impact. Therapeutic measures including probiotics,
      vagus nerve stimulation, antioxidants, alpha 7 nicotinic receptor agonists, and
      corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 antagonist may ameliorate
      neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in NCGS; they may therefore, prevent
      cognitive dysfunction and vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - We provide microarray data comparing genome-wide differential expression and
      pathology throughout life in four lines of "amyloid" transgenic mice (mutant
      human APP, PSEN1, or APP/PSEN1) and "TAU" transgenic mice (mutant human MAPT
      gene). Microarray data were validated by qPCR and by comparison to human studies,
      including genome-wide association study (GWAS) hits. Immune gene expression
      correlated tightly with plaques whereas synaptic genes correlated negatively with
      neurofibrillary tangles. Network analysis of immune gene modules revealed six hub
      genes in hippocampus of amyloid mice, four in common with cortex. The hippocampal
      network in TAU mice was similar except that Trem2 had hub status only in amyloid 
      mice. The cortical network of TAU mice was entirely different with more hub genes
      and few in common with the other networks, suggesting reasons for specificity of 
      cortical dysfunction in FTDP17. This Resource opens up many areas for
      investigation. All data are available and searchable at http://www.mouseac.org.

TI  - Serum NGAL is Associated with Distinct Plasma Amyloid-beta Peptides According to the Clinical Diagnosis of Dementia in Down Syndrome.
PG  - 733-43
LID - 10.3233/JAD-142514 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of people with Down syndrome (DS) develop dementia due
      to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuropathological features are characterized by an
      accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits and the presence of an activated
      immune response. Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) is a newly
      identified (neuro)inflammatory constituent in AD. OBJECTIVE: This study examines 
      NGAL as an inflammatory marker in DS and its associations with plasma Abeta
      peptides according to the follow-up clinical diagnosis of dementia. METHODS:
      Baseline serum NGAL and plasma Abeta40, Abeta42, Abeta(n40), and Abeta(n42) were 
      quantified in 204 people with DS. The diagnosis of dementia in DS was established
      by follow-up clinical assessments. The following study groups were characterized:
      DS with AD at baseline (n = 67), DS without AD (n = 53), and non-demented DS
      individuals that converted to AD (n = 84). Serum NGAL was analyzed in 55 elderly 
      non-DS, non-demented people. RESULTS: Serum NGAL levels were significantly
      increased in DS subjects compared to non-DS people. Serum NGAL levels were not
      associated with clinical dementia symptoms in DS. However, NGAL was positively
      associated with Abeta42 and Abeta(n42) in demented DS individuals and with
      Abeta40 and Abeta(n40) in the non-demented DS group. NGAL was negatively
      associated with Abeta42/Abeta40 and Abeta(n42)/Abeta(n40) ratios in converted DS 
      subjects. These associations persisted for Abeta(n40), Abeta42/Abeta40, and
      Abeta(n42)/Abeta(n40) after adjusting for demographics measures, apolipoprotein E
      epsilon4 allele, platelets, and anti-inflammatory medication. CONCLUSION: Serum
      NGAL levels are increased in DS and associated with distinct species of Abeta
      depending on the progression of dementia as diagnosed by baseline and follow-up
      clinical assessments.

TI  - Age-associated white matter lesions: the MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Study.
PG  - 35-43
LID - 10.1111/bpa.12219 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral white matter lesions (WML) are common in the aging brain and are
      associated with dementia and depression. They are associated with vascular risk
      factors and small vessel disease, suggesting an ischemic origin, but recent
      pathology studies suggest a more complex pathogenesis. Studies using samples from
      the population-representative Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and
      Ageing Study neuropathology cohort used post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging to
      identify WML for further study. Expression of hypoxia-related molecules and other
      injury and protective cellular pathways in candidate immunohistochemical and gene
      expression microarray studies support a role for hypoxia/ischemia. However, these
      approaches also suggest that immune activation, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, 
      altered cell metabolic pathways and glial cell injury contribute to pathogenesis.
      These abnormalities are not confined to WML, but are also found in apparently
      normal white matter in brains with lesions, suggesting a field effect of white
      matter abnormality within which lesions arise. WML are an active pathology with a
      complex pathogenesis that may potentially offer a number of primary and secondary
      intervention targets.

TI  - [Frailty syndrome: an old new friend].
PG  - 1935-51
LID - 10.1556/OH.2014.30039 [doi]
AB  - Frailty syndrome is defined as extreme stress vulnerability and decreased
      potential to adapt. The elderly and chronically ill patients are affected mostly.
      This condition increases the risk of adverse health outcomes as infections,
      falls, delirium, institutionalization, progression of comorbidities and
      mortality. The pathophysiological mechanism is a complex immune and
      neuroendocrine dysregulation. According to the phenotype model, frailty presents 
      when three of the followings occur: weakness, exhaustion, slowness, weight loss
      and decreased activity, while cumulative model counts the number of health
      deficits. Aging, frailty, dementia and depression are independent clinical
      entities; they may present separately but may also potentiate each other. Hence
      most of the frailty scales assess the physical, mental and social dimensions as
      well. Mild or moderate frailty is potentially reversible with an individualised
      caring plan. Given short, easy-to-use screening tools, risk groups can be
      identified in the primary care and referred to a specialised team for further
      treatment. Here the authors summarise the literature of a re-discovered, current 
      clinical phenomena, frailty syndrome, focusing on the practical issues in primary
      care.

PG  - 624-44
LID - 10.1007/s11064-014-1266-6 [doi]
AB  - The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic functional
      gastrointestinal disorder world wide that lasts for decades. The human gut
      harbors a diverse population of microbial organisms which is symbiotic and
      important for well being. However, studies on conventional, germ-free, and obese 
      animals have shown that alteration in normal commensal gut microbiota and an
      increase in pathogenic microbiota-termed "dysbiosis", impact gut function,
      homeostasis, and health. Diarrhea, constipation, visceral hypersensitivity, and
      abdominal pain arise in IBS from the gut-induced dysfunctional metabolic, immune,
      and neuro-immune communication. Dysbiosis in IBS is associated with gut
      inflammation. Gut-related inflammation is pivotal in promoting endotoxemia,
      systemic inflammation, and neuroinflammation. A significant proportion of IBS
      patients chronically consume alcohol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, and
      fatty diet; they may also suffer from co-morbid respiratory, neuromuscular,
      psychological, sleep, and neurological disorders. The above pathophysiological
      substrate is underpinned by dysbiosis, and dysfunctional bidirectional "Gut-Brain
      Axis" pathways. Pathogenic gut microbiota-related systemic inflammation (due to
      increased lipopolysaccharide and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and barrier
      dysfunction), may trigger neuroinflammation enhancing dysfunctional brain regions
      including hippocampus and cerebellum. These as well as dysfunctional vago-vagal
      gut-brain axis may promote cognitive impairment. Indeed, inflammation is
      characteristic of a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that manifest
      demntia. It is argued that an awareness of pathophysiological impact of IBS and
      implementation of appropriate therapeutic measures may prevent cognitive
      impairment and minimize vulnerability to dementia.

LID - 10.1017/S1041610214000039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic stress negatively affects health and well-being. A growing
      population of informal dementia caregivers experience chronic stress associated
      with extraordinary demands of caring for a relative with dementia. This review
      summarizes physiological and functional changes due to chronic dementia caregiver
      stress. METHODS: A literature search for papers assessing effects of dementia
      caregiving was conducted focusing on publications evaluating differences between 
      caregivers and non-caregivers in objective measures of health and cognition.
      RESULTS: The review identified 37 studies describing data from 4,145 participants
      including 749 dementia caregivers and 3,396 non-caregiver peers. Objective
      outcome measures affected in dementia caregivers included markers of
      dyscoagulation, inflammation, and cell aging as well as measures of immune
      function, sleep, and cognition. Though diverse in designs, samples, and study
      quality, the majority of the studies indicated increased vulnerability of
      dementia caregivers to detrimental changes in health and cognition. Demographic
      and personality characteristics moderating or mediating effects of chronic stress
      in caregivers were also reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: There is accumulating evidence
      that chronic dementia caregiver stress increases their vulnerability to disease
      and diminishes their ability to provide optimal care. Clinicians and society need
      to appreciate the extent of deleterious effects of chronic stress on dementia
      caregiver health.

PG  - 639-47
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1355497 [doi]
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic immune-mediated disease which 
      goes along with serious somatic and psychic symptoms. Whereas recent research
      rather focussed on the neurological symptoms of MS, there is nowadays an
      increasing interest among researchers in psychological symptoms of the disease.
      It is known that about half of the MS patients suffer from cognitive deficits,
      and that cognitive decline has a disadvantageous impact on lifestyle and quality 
      of life in affected persons. So far, cognitive deficits in subjects with MS have 
      been described as rather isolated, specific cognitive disturbances with otherwise
      intact intellectual abilities, while global deterioration of mental skills in
      terms of dementia is considered as being rather rare. In the present article, we 
      describe cognitive domains which are typically impaired in subjects with MS and
      reflect on the question if the diagnosis of dementia might be underrepresented in
      MS patients due to several reasons (e.g., progression of cognitive deficits in
      the course of the disorder, adhering very closely to memory deficits as cardinal 
      symptom of dementia, lack of longitudinal studies of cognitive performance
      levels). Furthermore, we recommend a multistage neuropsychological diagnostic
      procedure for clinical practice which aims at diagnosing cognitive deficits
      already in early stages of the illness. In so doing, practitioners may be able to
      offer adequate therapies to affected persons in all stages of the disorder in
      order to improve psychosocial functional levels.

TI  - Bidirectional relationship between cognitive function and pneumonia.
PG  - 586-92
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201212-2154OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Relationships between chronic health conditions and acute infections
      remain poorly understood. Preclinical studies suggest crosstalk between nervous
      and immune systems. OBJECTIVES: To determine bidirectional relationships between 
      cognition and pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted longitudinal analyses of a
      population-based cohort over 10 years. We determined whether changes in cognition
      increase risk of pneumonia hospitalization by trajectory analyses and joint
      modeling. We then determined whether pneumonia hospitalization increased risk of 
      subsequent dementia using a Cox model with pneumonia as a time-varying covariate.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 5,888 participants, 639 (10.9%) were
      hospitalized with pneumonia at least once. Most participants had normal cognition
      before pneumonia. Three cognition trajectories were identified: no, minimal, and 
      severe rapid decline. A greater proportion of participants hospitalized with
      pneumonia were on trajectories of minimal or severe decline before occurrence of 
      pneumonia compared with those never hospitalized with pneumonia (proportion with 
      no, minimal, and severe decline were 67.1%, 22.8%, and 10.0% vs. 76.0%, 19.3%,
      and 4.6% for participants with and without pneumonia, respectively; P < 0.001).
      Small subclinical changes in cognition increased risk of pneumonia, even in those
      with normal cognition and physical function before pneumonia (beta = -0.02; P <
      0.001). Participants with pneumonia were subsequently at an increased risk of
      dementia (hazard ratio, 2.24 [95% confidence interval, 1.62-3.11]; P = 0.01).
      Associations were independent of demographics, health behaviors, other chronic
      conditions, and physical function. Bidirectional relationship did not vary based 
      on severity of disease, and similar associations were noted for those with severe
      sepsis and other infections. CONCLUSIONS: A bidirectional relationship exists
      between pneumonia and cognition and may explain how a single episode of infection
      in well-appearing older individuals accelerates decline in chronic health
      conditions and loss of functional independence.

PG  - 89-97
LID - 10.3233/JAD-130353 [doi]
AB  - We have constructed a latent dementia proxy, "delta", and validated it in several
      datasets, including well characterized subjects participating in the Texas
      Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium (TARCC) study. It may be possible to
      construct delta homologs from almost any ad hoc combination of cognitive and
      functional status measures. delta homologs may also be relatively immune to
      measurement error, including cultural, linguistic, or educational biases. These
      properties make factor scores derived from latent variables a potentially
      attractive solution for dementia case-finding in rural or minority populations.
      Here we have explored an alternative and briefer assessment by which to construct
      a delta homolog and validate the resulting latent variable (dMA) in
      Mexican-American (MA) TARCC subjects. dMA, composed of simple "bedside" dementia 
      screening instruments, achieves Areas Under the Receiver Operative Curve that
      rival those of delta itself. Ethnicity has a small effect on dMA's performance.
      These results suggest that it may be possible to validly export dMA into other MA
      populations, or to export delta homolog factor scores from one population to
      another.

TI  - Binding of bovine T194A PrP(C) by PrP(Sc)-specific antibodies: potential implications for immunotherapy of familial prion diseases.
PG  - 301-11
LID - 10.4161/pri.25148 [doi]
AB  - Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are fatal neurodegenerative
      diseases that are based on the misfolding of a cellular prion protein (PrP(C))
      into an infectious, pathological conformation (PrP(Sc)). There is
      proof-of-principle evidence that a prion vaccine is possible but this is tempered
      with concerns of the potential dangers associated with induction of immune
      responses to a widely-expressed self-protein. By targeting epitopes that are
      specifically exposed upon protein misfolding, our group developed a vaccine that 
      induces PrP(Sc)-specific antibody responses. Here we consider the ability of this
      polyclonal antibody (SN6b) to bind to a mutant of PrP(C) associated with
      spontaneous prion disease. Polyclonal antibodies were selected to mimic the
      vaccination outcome and also explore all possible protein conformations of the
      recombinant bovine prion protein with mutation T194A [bPrP(T194A)]. This mutant
      is a homolog of the human T183A mutation of PrP(C) that is associated with early 
      onset of familial dementia. With nanopore analysis, under non-denaturing
      conditions, we observed binding of the SN6b antibody to bPrP(T194A). This
      interaction was confirmed through ELISAs as well as immunoprecipitation of the
      recombinant and cellularly expressed forms of bPrP(T194A). This interaction did
      not promote formation of a protease resistant conformation of PrP in vitro.
      Collectively, these findings support the disease-specific approach for
      immunotherapy of prion diseases but also suggest that the concept of
      conformation-specific immunotherapy may be complicated in individuals who are
      genetically predisposed to PrP(C) misfolding.

TI  - Neuroimaging of rapidly progressive dementias, part 1: neurodegenerative etiologies.
PG  - 418-23
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A3454 [doi]
AB  - Most dementias begin insidiously, developing slowly and generally occurring in
      the elderly age group. The so-called rapidly progressive dementias constitute a
      different, diverse collection of conditions, many of which are reversible or
      treatable. For this reason, prompt identification and assessment of acute and
      subacute forms of dementia are critical to effective treatment. Numerous other
      entities within this category of presenile rapid-onset dementias are untreatable 
      such as the prion-related diseases. Neuroimaging aids in the diagnosis and
      evaluation of many of these rapidly progressive dementias, which include myriad
      conditions ranging from variations of more common neurodegenerative dementias,
      such as Alzheimer disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal
      dementia; infectious-related dementias such as acquired immune deficiency
      syndrome dementia; autoimmune and malignancy-related conditions; to toxic and
      metabolic forms of encephalopathy. This first of a 2-part review will
      specifically address the ability of MR imaging and ancillary neuroimaging
      strategies to support the diagnostic evaluation of rapidly progressive dementias 
      due to neurodegenerative causes.

TI  - Yogic meditation reverses NF-kappaB and IRF-related transcriptome dynamics in leukocytes of family dementia caregivers in a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although yoga and meditation have been used for stress reduction with
      reported improvement in inflammation, little is known about the biological
      mechanisms mediating such effects. The present study examined if a yogic
      meditation might alter the activity of inflammatory and antiviral transcription
      control pathways that shape immune cell gene expression. METHODS: Forty-five
      family dementia caregivers were randomized to either Kirtan Kriya Meditation
      (KKM) or Relaxing Music (RM) listening for 12 min daily for 8 weeks and 39
      caregivers completed the study. Genome-wide transcriptional profiles were
      collected from peripheral blood leukocytes sampled at baseline and 8-week
      follow-up. Promoter-based bioinformatics analyses tested the hypothesis that
      observed transcriptional alterations were structured by reduced activity of the
      pro-inflammatory nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB family of transcription factors and
      increased activity of Interferon Response Factors (IRFs; i.e., reversal of
      patterns previously linked to stress). RESULTS: In response to KKM treatment, 68 
      genes were found to be differentially expressed (19 up-regulated, 49
      down-regulated) after adjusting for potentially confounded differences in sex,
      illness burden, and BMI. Up-regulated genes included immunoglobulin-related
      transcripts. Down-regulated transcripts included pro-inflammatory cytokines and
      activation-related immediate-early genes. Transcript origin analyses identified
      plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B lymphocytes as the primary cellular context of
      these transcriptional alterations (both p<.001). Promoter-based bioinformatic
      analysis implicated reduced NF-kappaB signaling and increased activity of IRF1 in
      structuring those effects (both p<.05). CONCLUSION: A brief daily yogic
      meditation intervention may reverse the pattern of increased NF-kappaB-related
      transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased IRF1-related
      transcription of innate antiviral response genes previously observed in healthy
      individuals confronting a significant life stressor.

TI  - The impact of inflammation on cognitive function in older adults: implications for healthcare practice and research.
PG  - 206-17
LID - 10.1097/JNN.0b013e3182527690 [doi]
AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that levels of inflammation, an immune response,
      increase with age throughout the body and the brain. The effects of inflammation 
      on the brain, both acute and chronic, have been associated with cognitive decline
      and risk of dementia in older adults. Factors believed to increase inflammation
      include certain health-related behaviors, such as smoking, poor diet, and
      inactivity as well as health conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease, most of which require medical intervention and
      monitoring. As such, nurses and healthcare professionals are likely to encounter 
      patients who are at a high risk for future development of inflammation-related
      cognitive decline. A review of inflammatory processes and their relation to
      cognitive function in older adults is provided, along with factors that may
      increase or reduce inflammation. Implications for practice and research are
      discussed.

TI  - A pilot study of yogic meditation for family dementia caregivers with depressive symptoms: effects on mental health, cognition, and telomerase activity.
PG  - 57-65
LID - 10.1002/gps.3790 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examined the effects of brief daily yogic meditation on
      mental health, cognitive functioning, and immune cell telomerase activity in
      family dementia caregivers with mild depressive symptoms. METHODS: Thirty-nine
      family dementia caregivers (mean age 60.3 years old (SD = 10.2)) were randomized 
      to practicing Kirtan Kriya or listening to relaxation music for 12 min per day
      for 8 weeks. The severity of depressive symptoms, mental and cognitive
      functioning were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Telomerase activity in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBC) was examined in peripheral PBMC
      pre-intervention and post-intervention. RESULTS: The meditation group showed
      significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms and greater improvement in
      mental health and cognitive functioning compared with the relaxation group. In
      the meditation group, 65.2% showed 50% improvement on the Hamilton Depression
      Rating scale and 52% of the participants showed 50% improvement on the Mental
      Health Composite Summary score of the Short Form-36 scale compared with 31.2% and
      19%, respectively, in the relaxation group (p < 0.05). The meditation group
      showed 43% improvement in telomerase activity compared with 3.7% in the
      relaxation group (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: This pilot study found that brief daily 
      meditation practices by family dementia caregivers can lead to improved mental
      and cognitive functioning and lower levels of depressive symptoms. This
      improvement is accompanied by an increase in telomerase activity suggesting
      improvement in stress-induced cellular aging. These results need to be confirmed 
      in a larger sample.

TI  - HIV infection and aging of the innate immune system.
PG  - 453-64
LID - 10.1071/SH11028 [doi]
AB  - The increased life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals due to improved
      treatment has revealed an unexpected increase in non-AIDS comorbidities that are 
      typically associated with older age including cardiovascular disease, dementia
      and frailty. The majority of these diseases arise as the result of dysregulated
      systemic inflammation, and both the aged and HIV-infected individuals exhibit
      elevated basal levels of inflammation. In the elderly, increased inflammation and
      age-related diseases are associated with a state of impaired immunity called
      immunosenescence, which is thought to result from a lifetime of immune
      stimulation. It is now apparent that HIV induces premature immunosenescence
      within T-cells; however, the impact of HIV on aging of cells of the innate arm of
      the immune system is unknown. Innate immune cells play a central role in
      inflammation and are thus critical for the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.
      Limited evidence suggests HIV infection mimics age-related changes to innate
      immune cells; however, the extent of this effect and the mechanism underlying
      these changes remain to be defined. This review focuses on the impact of HIV
      infection on the function and aging of innate immune cells and discusses
      potential drivers of premature immunosenescence including chronic endotoxaemia,
      residual viraemia, telomere attrition and altered cellular signalling.

AB  - Cognitive disorders such as dementia, attention deficits, and Alzheimer's disease
      (AD) have been well investigated. However, effective interventions for the
      promotion and progression of AD are unavailable to date. The present work was
      undertaken to investigate the effects of the aqueous (300 and 500 mg/kg) and
      alcoholic (300 and 500 mg/kg) extracts of Ocimum sanctum Linn. leaves as an
      antidementic and anticholinesterase agent and also as an immunostimulant in rats.
      Maximal electroshock, atropine, and cyclosporine were used to induce dementia.
      The passive avoidance task was used for assessing memory. Acetylcholinesterase
      (AChE) activity was estimated in different parts of the brain, and immune status 
      was studied using dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) skin sensitivity tests. In all the 
      three models both aqueous and alcoholic O. sanctum extracts decreased the time
      taken to reach the shock-free zone and the number of mistakes and significantly
      decreased the AChE activity in rats. O. sanctum treatment significantly increased
      the induration in the DNCB skin test. Therefore, O. sanctum was shown to be
      useful for the management of experimentally induced cognitive dysfunctions in
      rats.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Heightened awareness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) among
      physicians and the lay public has led to its frequent consideration in the
      differential diagnosis of patients with rapidly progressive dementia (RPD). Our
      goal was to determine which treatable disorders are most commonly mistaken for
      CJD. METHODS: We performed a retrospective clinical and neuropathological review 
      of prion-negative brain autopsy cases referred to the US National Prion Disease
      Pathology Surveillance Center at Case Western Reserve University from January
      2006 through December 2009. RESULTS: Of 1,106 brain autopsies, 352 (32%) were
      negative for prion disease, 304 of which had adequate tissue for
      histopathological analysis. Alzheimer disease (n = 154) and vascular dementia (n 
      = 36) were the 2 most frequent diagnoses. Seventy-one patients had potentially
      treatable diseases. Clinical findings included dementia (42 cases), pyramidal (n 
      = 20), cerebellar (n = 14), or extrapyramidal (n = 12) signs, myoclonus (n = 12),
      visual disturbance (n = 9), and akinetic mutism (n = 5); a typical
      electroencephalogram occurred only once. Neuropathological diagnoses included
      immune-mediated disorders (n = 26), neoplasia (n = 25, most often lymphoma),
      infections (n = 14), and metabolic disorders (n = 6). INTERPRETATION: In patients
      with RPD, treatable disorders should be considered and excluded before diagnosing
      CJD. Misdiagnosed patients often did not fulfill World Health Organization
      criteria. RPD with positive 14-3-3 cerebrospinal fluid protein should not be
      regarded as sufficient for the diagnosis of CJD. Adherence to revised criteria
      for CJD, which include distinctive magnetic resonance imaging features of prion
      disease, is likely to improve diagnostic accuracy.

PG  - 475-84
LID - 10.3233/JAD-2011-101848 [doi]
AB  - We performed a survey of sequence variation in a series of 20 genes involved in
      inflammation-related pathways for association with dementia risk in twin and
      unrelated case-control samples consisting in total of 1462 Swedish dementia
      casesand 1929 controls. For a total of 218 tested genetic markers, strong
      evidence was obtained implicating a region near AGER and NOTCH4 on chromosome 6p 
      with replication across both samples and maximum combined significance at marker 
      rs1800625 (OR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.19-1.56, p = 1.36x10(-6)). Imputation of the
      associated genomic interval provided an improved signal atrs8365, near the 3UTR
      of AGER (p = 7.34x10(-7)). The associated region extends 120 kb encompassing 11
      candidate genes.While AGER encodes a key receptor for amyloid-beta protein, an
      analysis of network context based upon genes now confirmed to contribute to
      dementia risk (AbetaPP, PSEN1, PSEN2, CR1, CLU, PICALM, and APOE) suggested
      strong functional coupling to NOTCH4, with no significant coupling to the
      remaining candidates. The implicated region occurs in the broad HLA locus on
      chromosome 6p, but associated markers were not in strong LD with known variants
      that regulate HLA gene function, suggesting that this may represent a signal
      distinct from immune-system pathways.

TI  - Polyneuropathy and dementia in old age: common inflammatory and vascular parameters.
PG  - 721-5
LID - 10.1007/s00702-011-0579-8 [doi]
AB  - Thirty-three inpatients (22 females, 11 males, aged 79.4 +/- 9.5 years) were
      investigated in this prospective cohort study to study the prevalence of
      polyneuropathy (PNP) and dementia in geriatric inpatients. Clinical and
      electrodiagnostic investigations, routine laboratory, including thyroid
      parameters, folic acid, vitamin B(12), homocysteine, neopterin, fibrinogen and
      glycosylated hemoglobin were measured in serum, the mini-mental state examination
      and computed tomographic scanning were performed in each patient. PNP was found
      clinically and electrodiagnostically in 96% of patients. Age was the most
      precipitating factor for PNP, and was significantly correlated to
      electrodiagnostic changes in the nerves investigated in both, upper and lower
      extremities, while clinical symptoms were confined only to the feet. Correlation 
      was seen between homocysteine and the amplitude of the sural nerve (surAmpl) (rs 
      = -0.406, p = 0.029) as well as the sural nerve conduction velocity (surNCV) (rs 
      = -0.389, p = 0.037), and between neopterin and the grade of denervation (rs =
      0.445, p = 0.014) in our patients. Neopterin and fibrinogen did not correlate
      significantly, but there was a trend to higher fibrinogen concentrations in
      patients with higher neopterin levels (rs = 0.344, p = 0.062). A trend of a
      correlation was seen between higher homocysteine concentrations and the number of
      changes in electrodiagnostic measurements (rs = 0.354, p = 0.055). Twenty-one of 
      the 33 patients (64%) were demented, 9 (27%) presented clinically as mild
      cognitive impairment, 3 (9%) were not demented. Vascular risk factors were found 
      in 83%: hypertension in 58%, hypercholesterinemia in 39%, cardiac disease in 36%,
      diabetes mellitus (DM) in 21%, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in 9%. A
      significant correlation was found between homocysteine and folic acid
      concentrations (rs = -0.401, p = 0.028). Falls were reported in 48% of cases,
      indicating PNP as a risk factor in this group of patients. In conclusion, PNP was
      found very common with a high coincidence with dementia and a female
      preponderance, suggesting an influence on daily life (falls) in our subjects
      studied. PNP correlated significantly with markers for vascular disease as well
      as immune activation (homocysteine and neopterin) similar to earlier findings in 
      patients with neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting common therapeutic options 
      in patients with PNP and dementia.

AB  - Inflammatory mechanisms have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
      dementia. We therefore sought to study DNA sequence variation and serum levels of
      the potent inflammatory mediators Interleukin-6 (IL6) and C-reactive protein
      (CRP) in relation to AD and dementia. Tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (tagSNPs) were chosen to capture most variation in and around CRP and IL6 in 3937
      elderly Swedish men and women (1,265 AD cases). A sub-set of the population (n = 
      723) with serum measurements of CRP and IL6 was included in 1) a nested
      case-control study of incident dementia cases, and 2) a case-control study of
      prevalent dementia cases. None of the SNPs or haplotypes was significantly
      associated with AD or dementia after correcting for multiple testing nor were
      elevated baseline levels of hsCRP or IL6 (measured on average 4.3 years before
      dementia onset) significantly associated with risk of future AD or dementia.
      However, prevalent AD cases had higher levels of IL6 (measured on average 5.5
      years after dementia onset) than age- and gender-matched controls, OR 2.24 (95%
      CI 1.27-3.95), p-value 0.006. In summary, this data suggests that AD patients
      have an altered immune profile with higher circulating levels of IL6 than age-
      and gender-matched controls. However, neither variation in the CRP and IL6 genes 
      nor circulating levels of their respective protein products were associated with 
      an increased risk of developing late-life dementias.

TI  - Heavy smoking in midlife and long-term risk of Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia.
PG  - 333-9
LID - 10.1001/archinternmed.2010.393 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking is a risk factor for several life-threatening diseases, but
      its long-term association with dementia is controversial and somewhat
      understudied. Our objective was to investigate the long-term association of
      amount of smoking in middle age on the risk of dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), 
      and vascular dementia (VaD) several decades later in a large, diverse population.
      METHODS: We analyzed prospective data from a multiethnic population-based cohort 
      of 21,123 members of a health care system who participated in a survey between
      1978 and 1985. Diagnoses of dementia, AD, and VaD made in internal medicine,
      neurology, and neuropsychology were collected from January 1, 1994, to July 31,
      2008. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the
      association between midlife smoking and risk of dementia, AD, and VaD. RESULTS: A
      total of 5367 people (25.4%) were diagnosed as having dementia (including 1136
      cases of AD and 416 cases of VaD) during a mean follow-up period of 23 years.
      Results were adjusted for age, sex, education, race, marital status,
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, body mass index, diabetes, heart disease, stroke,
      and alcohol use. Compared with nonsmokers, those smoking more than 2 packs a day 
      had an elevated risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.14; 95% CI,
      1.65-2.78), AD (adjusted HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.63-4.03), and VaD (adjusted HR,
      2.72; 95% CI, 1.20-6.18). CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort, heavy smoking in
      midlife was associated with a greater than 100% increase in risk of dementia, AD,
      and VaD more than 2 decades later. These results suggest that the brain is not
      immune to long-term consequences of heavy smoking.

TI  - The cure of ageing: vitamin D--magic or myth?
PG  - 608-16
LID - 10.1136/pgmj.2010.101121 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D was initially thought only to function in calcium homeostasis. However,
      it has multiple roles in human health, including neuromuscular and immune
      modulation. Recently, its deficiency is increasingly implicated in many diseases.
      This discovery has led both popular culture and research to find ways that
      vitamin D can either treat or prevent many diseases. Since vitamin D not only
      affects the expression of many genes, but also has intra-individual
      pharmacokinetic variation, a simplistic cause and effect between vitamin D
      deficiency and illnesses should not be expected. Older adults pose a challenge
      not only because diseases become more prevalent with ageing, but they also are
      often complicated with other comorbidities. This article reviews the link of
      vitamin D deficiency and the associated medical conditions in middle aged and
      older adults. It also examines the variability in testing vitamin D values and
      evaluates dosing recommendations based on current evidence.

TI  - Autoimmune dementia: clinical course and predictors of immunotherapy response.
PG  - 881-97
LID - 10.4065/mcp.2010.0326 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the diagnostic characteristics and predictors of treatment
      response in patients with suspected autoimmune dementia. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Between January 1, 2002, and January 1, 2009, 72 consecutive patients received
      immunotherapy for suspected autoimmune dementia. Their baseline clinical,
      radiologic, and serologic characteristics were reviewed and compared between
      patients who were responsive to immunotherapy and those who were not. Patients
      were classified as responders if the treating physician had reported improvement 
      after immunotherapy (documented in 80% by the Kokmen Short Test of Mental Status,
      neuropsychological testing, or both). RESULTS: Initial immunotherapeutic regimens
      included methylprednisolone in 56 patients (78%), prednisone in 12 patients
      (17%), dexamethasone in 2 patients (3%), intravenous immune globulin in 1 patient
      (1%), and plasma exchange in 1 patient (1%). Forty-six patients (64%) improved,
      most in the first week of treatment. Thirty-five percent of these immunotherapy
      responders were initially diagnosed as having a neurodegenerative or prion
      disorder. Pretreatment and posttreatment neuropsychological score comparisons
      revealed improvement in almost all cognitive domains, most notably learning and
      memory. Radiologic or electroencephalographic improvements were reported in 22
      (56%) of 39 patients. Immunotherapy responsiveness was predicted by a subacute
      onset (P<.001), fluctuating course (P<.001), tremor (P=.007), shorter delay to
      treatment (P=.005), seropositivity for a cation channel complex autoantibody
      (P=.01; neuronal voltage-gated potassium channel more than calcium channel or
      neuronal acetylcholine receptor), and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein (>100 
      mg/dL) or pleocytosis (P=.02). Of 26 immunotherapy-responsive patients followed
      up for more than 1 year, 20 (77%) relapsed after discontinuing immunotherapy.
      CONCLUSION: Identification of clinical and serologic clues to an autoimmune
      dementia allows early initiation of immunotherapy, and maintenance if needed,
      thus favoring an optimal outcome.

TI  - Nitric oxide signaling in brain function, dysfunction, and dementia.
PG  - 435-52
LID - 10.1177/1073858410366481 [doi]
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule that is widely used in the
      nervous system. With recognition of its roles in synaptic plasticity (long-term
      potentiation, LTP; long-term depression, LTD) and elucidation of
      calcium-dependent, NMDAR-mediated activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase
      (nNOS), numerous molecular and pharmacological tools have been used to explore
      the physiology and pathological consequences for nitrergic signaling. In this
      review, the authors summarize the current understanding of this subtle signaling 
      pathway, discuss the evidence for nitrergic modulation of ion channels and
      homeostatic modulation of intrinsic excitability, and speculate about the
      pathological consequences of spillover between different nitrergic compartments
      in contributing to aberrant signaling in neurodegenerative disorders.
      Accumulating evidence points to various ion channels and particularly
      voltage-gated potassium channels as signaling targets, whereby NO mediates
      activity-dependent control of intrinsic neuronal excitability; such changes could
      underlie broader mechanisms of synaptic plasticity across neuronal networks. In
      addition, the inability to constrain NO diffusion suggests that spillover from
      endothelium (eNOS) and/or immune compartments (iNOS) into the nervous system
      provides potential pathological sources of NO and where control failure in these 
      other systems could have broader neurological implications. Abnormal NO signaling
      could therefore contribute to a variety of neurodegenerative pathologies such as 
      stroke/excitotoxicity, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's
      disease.

PG  - 150-6
LID - 10.1159/000312657 [doi]
AB  - Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are immune-mediated effects of cancer that 
      involve the nervous system and are associated with various anti-neuronal
      antibodies. They can be associated with several cancers such as lung,
      gynecologic, thymic, testicular and others, but the diagnosis of cancer often
      becomes a challenge, since paraneoplastic neurological syndromes usually precede 
      the cancer presentation by months or even years. Furthermore, even when the
      cancer develops, the tumor size remains small and usually undetectable by
      conventional diagnostic tests and imaging. Positron emission tomography imaging
      may be an adjunct to timely diagnosis of the occult malignancy in order to employ
      the specific cancer treatment. Furthermore, positron emission tomography can
      assess the extent of the functional abnormality in the brain and monitor its
      response to treatment.

TI  - Essential fatty acids and human brain.
PG  - 231-41
AB  - The human brain is nearly 60 percent fat. We've learned in recent years that
      fatty acids are among the most crucial molecules that determine your brain's
      integrity and ability to perform. Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are required for
      maintenance of optimal health but they can not synthesized by the body and must
      be obtained from dietary sources. Clinical observation studies has related
      imbalance dietary intake of fatty acids to impaired brain performance and
      diseases. Most of the brain growth is completed by 5-6 years of age. The EFAs,
      particularly the omega-3 fatty acids, are important for brain development during 
      both the fetal and postnatal period. Dietary decosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is needed
      for the optimum functional maturation of the retina and visual cortex, with
      visual acuity and mental development seemingly improved by extra DHA. Beyond
      their important role in building the brain structure, EFAs, as messengers, are
      involved in the synthesis and functions of brain neurotransmitters, and in the
      molecules of the immune system. Neuronal membranes contain phospholipid pools
      that are the reservoirs for the synthesis of specific lipid messengers on
      neuronal stimulation or injury. These messengers in turn participate in signaling
      cascades that can either promote neuronal injury or neuroprotection. The goal of 
      this review is to give a new understanding of how EFAs determine our brain's
      integrity and performance, and to recall the neuropsychiatric disorders that may 
      be influenced by them. As we further unlock the mystery of how fatty acids affect
      the brain and better understand the brain's critical dependence on specific EFAs,
      correct intake of the appropriate diet or supplements becomes one of the tasks we
      undertake in pursuit of optimal wellness.

TI  - Glioblastoma and dementia may share a common cause.
PG  - 67-8
LID - 10.1016/j.mehy.2010.01.031 [doi]
AB  - The cause of most glioblastomas is unknown. One cause might lie in the
      surrounding brain tissue. The interactions between glioblastoma cells and their
      micro- and macro-environment could create a context that promotes or suppresses
      tumor growth and protects or exposes the malignant cells to immune attack.
      Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a protein misfolding disorder
      (proteopathy), caused by accumulation of abnormally folded A-beta and tau
      proteins in the brain. These or other changed proteins or as yet unrecognized
      biochemical brain changes of dementia might promote glioblastoma development.
      Published data indicate that there is an association between Alzheimer's disease 
      prevalence and malignant brain tumor incidence in 19 US states. Hypothetically,
      Alzheimer's and glioblastoma may share an as yet unknown peripheral tissue
      pathway that can promote the progression of both diseases. If this pathway can be
      identified, new treatments for both conditions may follow.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory effects of antidepressants: possibilities for preventives against Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 12-9
AB  - Increasing evidence of pro-inflammatory mediator expression in major depressions 
      indicate that inflammatory changes may play a role. If this is true, the efficacy
      of antidepressants may be partially attributable to suppression of inflammation. 
      Various types of antidepressants can suppress serum and plasma levels of
      pro-inflammatory mediators in patients with major depression. Therefore they can 
      inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by immune cells. These
      include glial cells, which are the main sources and targets of cytokines in the
      brain. This review summarizes the evidence showing that antidepressants have an
      anti-inflammatory potential. The putative mechanisms are also discussed. Because 
      of the anti-inflammatory effects of antidepressants, they might also act as
      preventives for neurodegenerative dementias including Alzheimer's disease, where 
      the pathogenesis involves chronic inflammation associated with activated
      microglia.

TI  - Dynamics of telomerase activity in response to acute psychological stress.
PG  - 531-9
LID - 10.1016/j.bbi.2009.11.018 [doi]
AB  - Telomerase activity plays an essential role in cell survival, by lengthening
      telomeres and promoting cell growth and longevity. It is now possible to quantify
      the low levels of telomerase activity in human leukocytes. Low basal telomerase
      activity has been related to chronic stress in people and to chronic
      glucocorticoid exposure in vitro. Here we test whether leukocyte telomerase
      activity changes under acute psychological stress. We exposed 44 elderly women,
      including 22 high stress dementia caregivers and 22 matched low stress controls, 
      to a brief laboratory psychological stressor, while examining changes in
      telomerase activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). At baseline,
      caregivers had lower telomerase activity levels than controls, but during stress 
      telomerase activity increased similarly in both groups. Across the entire sample,
      subsequent telomerase activity increased by 18% one hour after the end of the
      stressor (p<0.01). The increase in telomerase activity was independent of changes
      in numbers or percentages of monocytes, lymphocytes, and specific T cell types,
      although we cannot fully rule out some potential contribution from immune cell
      redistribution in the change in telomerase activity. Telomerase activity
      increases were associated with greater cortisol increases in response to the
      stressor. Lastly, psychological response to the tasks (greater threat perception)
      was also related to greater telomerase activity increases in controls. These
      findings uncover novel relationships of dynamic telomerase activity with exposure
      to an acute stressor, and with two classic aspects of the stress response -
      perceived psychological stress and neuroendocrine (cortisol) responses to the
      stressor.

TI  - Gain in brain immunity in the oldest-old differentiates cognitively normal from demented individuals.
PG  - e7642
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0007642 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent findings suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      neuropathological features (neuritic plaques and NFTs) are not strongly
      associated with dementia in extreme old (over 90 years of age) and compel a
      search for neurobiological indices of dementia in this rapidly growing segment of
      the elderly population. We sought to characterize transcriptional and protein
      profiles of dementia in the oldest-old. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Gene and protein
      expression changes relative to non-demented age-matched controls were assessed by
      two microarray platforms, qPCR and Western blot in different regions of the
      brains of oldest-old and younger old persons who died at mild or severe stages of
      dementia. Our results indicate that: i) consistent with recent neuropathological 
      findings, gene expression changes associated with cognitive impairment in
      oldest-old persons are distinct from those in cognitively impaired youngest-old
      persons; ii) transcripts affected in young-old subjects with dementia participate
      in biological pathways related to synaptic function and neurotransmission while
      transcripts affected in oldest-old subjects with dementia are associated with
      immune/inflammatory function; iii) upregulation of immune response genes in
      cognitively intact oldest-old subjects and their subsequent downregulation in
      dementia suggests a potential protective role of the brain immune-associated
      system against dementia in the oldest-old; iv) consistent with gene expression
      profiles, protein expression of several selected genes associated with the
      inflammatory/immune system in inferior temporal cortex is significantly increased
      in cognitively intact oldest-old persons relative to cognitively intact young-old
      persons, but impaired in cognitively compromised oldest-old persons relative to
      cognitively intact oldest-old controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that
      disruption of the robust immune homeostasis that is characteristic of oldest-old 
      individuals who avoided dementia may be directly associated with dementia in the 
      oldest-old and contrast with the synaptic and neurotransmitter system failures
      that typify dementia in younger old persons.

AB  - The advancement of medical sciences during the last century has resulted in a
      considerable increase in life expectancy. As more people live to old age, one of 
      the most fundamental questions of the 21st century is whether the number of
      individuals suffering from dementia will also continue to increase. Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) accounts for the majority of cases of dementia in the elderly, but
      there is currently no curative treatment available. Several strategies have been 
      introduced for treatment, the most recent strategy of which was the immunization 
      of patients using antibodies against Abeta, which is a naturally occurring, even 
      though misfolded peptide in the AD brain. Both active and passive immunization
      routes have been shown to reduce the pathology associated with Abeta accumulation
      in brains of genetically designed animal models. However, despite tremendous
      efforts, no unequivocal proof of therapeutic efficacy could be shown in AD
      patients. Particularly, the persistence of the neurofibrillary tangles in
      immunized brains and the issue of inducing cerebral amyloid angiopathy are major 
      limiting factors of antibody therapy. Furthermore, physical activity, a healthy
      immune system and nutritional habits are suggested to protect against the onset
      of age-associated dementia. Thus, accumulative evidence suggests that an early
      integrated strategy, combining pharmacological, immunological, nutritional and
      life-style factors, is the most pragmatic approach to delay the onset and
      progression of age-associated dementia.

AB  - Dementia is characterized by a decline in cognitive faculties and occurrence of
      behavioral abnormalities which interfere with an individual's activities of daily
      living. Dementing disorders usually affect elderly individuals but may occur in
      individuals younger than 65 years (early-onset dementia or EOD). EOD is often
      misdiagnosed or its diagnosis is delayed due to the fact that it has a more
      varied differential diagnosis than late-onset dementia. EOD affects individuals
      at the height of their career and productivity and produces devastating
      consequences and financial loss for the patient's family as well as society. EOD 
      is not uncommon and is diagnosed in up to a third of patients presenting with
      dementia. Most importantly, some of the causes of EOD are curable which makes the
      need for a specific and timely diagnosis crucial. The present chapter presents a 
      systematic approach to the differential diagnosis of EOD and provides readers
      with the clinical and neuroimaging features of these disorders as well as
      important considerations for their diagnostic evaluation. Specifically, the
      nuances of assessing the history and examination are discussed with careful
      attention to the various methods of cognitive and behavioral evaluation. A
      step-wise approach to diagnostic testing is followed by a discussion of
      anatomical localization, which often aids in identifying specific etiologies.
      Finally, in order to organize the subject for the reader, the various etiologies 
      are grouped under the general categories of vascular, infectious,
      toxic-metabolic, immune-mediated, neoplastic/metastatic, and neurodegenerative.

TI  - Dementia caregiving in spousal relationships: a dyadic perspective.
PG  - 426-36
LID - 10.1080/13607860902879441 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The number of couples facing a dementia diagnosis for one partner of 
      the spousal dyad increases. Spousal caregiving can be a highly stressful
      experience associated with negative caregiver outcomes such as depression and
      poorer immune function. However, surprisingly little is known about how the
      illness and the required care effects patient's well-being and relational changes
      experienced by afflicted couples. The aim of this study was to provide a
      literature review on how the dyadic perspective is taken into account and on how 
      dementia effects both parts of the dyad. METHODS: In order to outline findings
      about individual and dyadic well-being of affected couples, we conducted a
      literature search to review the three types of studies. First, studies focusing
      on one partner's perspective, usually the perspective of the caregiver; second,
      studies including the caregiver's and partially the care receiver's view; third, 
      studies directly referring to both partners' perspectives. RESULTS: The majority 
      of studies neglect the individual with dementia by exclusively assessing
      caregiver variables or only indirectly including patients' characteristics. Very 
      few studies embrace dyadic and relational variables to execute how both partners 
      experience the illness, spousal caregiving, and changes in the relationship.
      Despite the arguable validity of self reports of individuals with dementia, some 
      studies demonstrated the usefulness of including both partners' perspectives.
      DISCUSSION: Results indicate the urgent need of integrating the perspective of
      the individual with dementia to improve the understanding of the effects of
      dementia caregiving. Directly assessing the dyadic perspective of affected
      couples provides essential information for interventions.

AB  - Subjects with Down syndrome (DS) have abnormalities in virtually all aspects of
      the immune system and almost all will be affected with Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      It is thought that nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the pathophysiology of AD. In
      the present study, including a total of 401 elderly DS subjects, the spectrum of 
      plasma amino acids and neopterin was investigated and related to development of
      AD. Concentrations of nearly all amino acids in DS subjects differed
      significantly from those of healthy controls. Neopterin was increased in DS
      subjects, especially in dementia. The production of NO as reflected by an
      increased citrulline/arginine ratio (Cit/Arg ratio) was enhanced during
      development of clinical dementia. Neopterin concentrations correlated to the
      Cit/Arg ratio only in the group of prevalent demented subjects (rho = 0.48, P =
      0.006). The results of this study are suggestive for an increase in oxidative
      processes in DS subjects with AD.

AB  - Persons with Down syndrome show an altered immune response and an increased
      susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease. In a prospective study, we examined
      whether the plasma neopterin level, a marker for cell-mediated immune activation 
      and inflammation, is associated with an increased risk of dementia in persons
      with Down syndrome. Plasma concentrations of neopterin were determined in a
      population-based study of 394 persons with Down syndrome, who were screened
      annually for dementia. We used Cox proportional hazards model to determine risk
      of dementia. Demented persons with Down syndrome have a significantly (p=0.05)
      higher plasma neopterin concentration than the non-demented. In the non-demented 
      without autoimmune disorders, in those with a plasma level of neopterin above
      median, the risk to develop dementia increased to 1.83 (95% confidence interval: 
      1.04-3.20). High plasma neopterin level is an independent determinant of the risk
      of dementia in persons with Down syndrome.

TI  - Inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
PG  - 625-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a fatal, transmissible
      spongiform encephalopathy characterized by rapidly progressive dementia,
      myoclonus, ataxia and akinetic mutism. The underlying mechanism is believed to be
      a conformational change of a native prion protein which characteristically fails 
      to provoke an immune response. Commensurate with the latter, cerebrospinal fluid 
      (CSF) classically exhibits a non-inflammatory profile. CASES: We report two
      patients with pathologically-proven sporadic CJD presenting with a significant
      CSF pleocytosis. CONCLUSION: Although uncommon, the presence of an inflammatory
      CSF profile should not exclude the diagnosis of sporadic CJD.

TI  - Hashimoto's encephalopathy.
PG  - 254-65
LID - 10.1196/annals.1444.018 [doi]
AB  - Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) is a controversial neurological disorder that
      comprises a heterogenous group of neurological symptoms that manifest in patients
      with high titers of antithyroid antibodies. Clinical manifestations of HE may
      include encephalopathic features such as seizures, behavioral and psychiatric
      manifestations, movement disorders, and coma. Although it has been linked to
      cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis or thyroid dysfunction, the most common
      immunological feature of HE is the presence of high titers of antithyroglobulin
      or anti-TPO (antimicrosomal) antibodies. At present, it is unclear whether
      antithyroid antibodies represent an immune epiphenomenon in a subset of patients 
      with encephalopathic processes or they are really associated with pathogenic
      mechanisms of the disorder. The significance of classifying encephalopathies
      under the term HE will be determined in the future once the relevance of the role
      of antithyroid antibodies is demonstrated or dismissed by more detailed
      experimental and immunopathological studies. The responsiveness of HE to steroids
      or other therapies such as plasmapheresis supports the hypothesis that this is a 
      disorder that involves immune pathogenic mechanisms. Further controlled studies
      of the use of steroids, plasmapheresis, or immunosuppressant medications are
      needed in the future to prove the concept of the pathogenic role of antithyroid
      antibodies in HE.

TI  - Stress, distress and mucosal immunity in carers of a partner with fronto-temporal dementia.
PG  - 595-604
LID - 10.1080/13607860802343076 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the psychological and physiological impact of
      caring for a partner with fronto-temporal dementia (FTD). Carers were expected to
      exhibit greater stress and poorer psychological well-being in comparison with
      non-carers, and suppressed mucosal immunity. METHOD: Twenty-five carers and 36
      non-carers completed standardised psychological assessments of perceived stress, 
      psychological well-being, coping and social support. Levels of mucosal immunity
      were assessed in saliva samples collected over the 3 days of the study, alongside
      daily assessments of stress, arousal and mood. RESULTS: Informal carers as a
      group reported greater stress and poorer psychological well-being, but there was 
      considerable variation, with some carers reporting better psychological
      functioning than non-carers. Immune levels were not suppressed in carers compared
      with non-carers; counter to hypothesis, there was a positive correlation between 
      immunity and poorer psychological well-being. CONCLUSIONS: This research suggests
      that caring for a partner with FTD increases distress and carers might benefit
      from psychological intervention. However, the variation in psychological
      well-being requires explanation. Furthermore, this first examination of mucosal
      immunity employing participants experiencing enduring stress suggests that, in
      contrast to previous research, enduring stress does not lead to suppression of
      mucosal immunity and may actually enhance it.

TI  - Perspectives on obesity and sweeteners, folic acid fortification and vitamin D requirements.
PG  - i44-9
LID - 10.1093/fampra/cmn058 [doi]
AB  - This review summarizes three controversial areas of clinical practice that were
      discussed in many articles that appeared in the American Journal of Clinical
      Nutrition during the author's tenure as editor in chief. Controversy 1-obesity
      and high-fructose corn syrup. The increased frequency of obesity in the US is
      paralleled by increasing annual consumption of high-fructose corn syrup, an
      extracted sweetener that is routinely added to soft drinks and to many processed 
      foods in the US diet. Metabolic studies implicate increased fructose consumption 
      in increased body fat and obesity and with increased circulating triglyceride
      levels and hypercholesterolaemia in children. Controversy 2-folic acid
      fortification and supplements. Together with widespread use of supplemental
      multivitamins, fortification of the US diet with folic acid has resulted in high 
      serum folate levels in much of the population, which may be associated with
      increased risk of cognitive decline in ageing people with low vitamin B12 status,
      decreased natural killer T-cell immune function and increased risk of recurrent
      advanced precancerous colorectal adenomas and breast cancer. Controversy
      3-recommended intakes of vitamin D. Levels of serum 25(OH)D sufficient for
      fracture prevention are at least 75 nmol/l (30 ng/ml) but cannot be achieved by
      the current recommended dietary intakes in the US. A recent fracture risk
      prevention trial showed that the 4-year incidence of all cancers was reduced in
      US women who received high supplemental doses of both calcium and vitamin D.

TI  - Immunity and cognition: what do age-related dementia, HIV-dementia and 'chemo-brain' have in common?
PG  - 455-63
LID - 10.1016/j.it.2008.07.007 [doi]
AB  - Until recently, dogma dictated that the immune system and the central nervous
      system (CNS) live mostly separate, parallel lives, and any interactions between
      the two were assumed to be limited to extreme cases of pathological insult. It
      was only a decade ago that T cells in the injured brain were shown to play a
      protective rather than a destructive role. In this article, we explore the role
      of the immune system in the healthy brain, focusing on the key function that T
      lymphocytes have in the regulation of cognition. We discuss candidate mechanisms 
      underlying T cell-mediated control of cognitive function in human cognitive
      diseases associated with immune decline, such as age- and HIV-related dementias, 
      'chemo-brain' and others.

TI  - Caregiving, repetitive thought, and immune response to vaccination in older adults.
PG  - 744-52

AB  - Chronic stressors such as caregiving have been associated with reduced antibody
      production after vaccination and elevated interleukin (IL)-6 in older adults.
      However, individual differences in repetitive thought, that is, frequent or
      prolonged thought about oneself and one's world, can modify perception and
      effects of stress. For example, worry during stressful circumstances has been
      associated with poorer immune outcomes, whereas cognitive processing has been
      associated with better outcomes. The present study tested the relationship of
      caregiving and two types of repetitive thought, negative (e.g., worry) and
      neutral (e.g., reflection), to pre- and post-influenza vaccine antibody and IL-6.
      Dementia caregivers (n=14) and controls (n=30) were interviewed and had blood
      drawn pre- and post-vaccine in a multi-wave study. Multi-level models found that 
      caregivers had higher IL-6 than controls after vaccination (t(23)=2.36, p<.05).
      There were several interactions between caregiver status and repetitive thought
      in predicting both depression and immune responses to vaccination. Among
      caregivers, negative repetitive thought predicted more depression and lower
      antibody titers, whereas neutral repetitive thought predicted less depression and
      higher antibody titers, but also higher post-vaccination IL-6. Among controls,
      negative repetitive thought predicted more depression but higher antibody titers,
      whereas neutral repetitive thought predicted less depression and lower
      post-vaccination IL-6. In mediational tests, depression did not account for the
      effects of repetitive thought. Results generally support beneficial effects of
      neutral repetitive thought and detrimental effects of negative repetitive
      thought, but those effects may be reduced or even reversed depending on life
      circumstances.

TI  - HIV's double strike at the brain: neuronal toxicity and compromised neurogenesis.
PG  - 2484-94
AB  - Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and acquired
      immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are often associated with severe and
      debilitating neurological problems that include behavioral abnormalities, motor
      dysfunction and frank dementia. HIV-1-infected peripheral immune cells, in
      particular macrophages, appear to infiltrate the CNS, release neurotoxins and
      provoke a neuropathological response involving all cell types in the brain. In
      the CNS, HIV-1 and its components initiate activation of chemokine receptors,
      inflammatory mediators and glutamate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity, all of
      which can activate numerous downstream signaling pathways and disturb neuronal
      and glial function. Recent experimental evidence suggests that disturbance by
      HIV-1 results not only in neuronal injury and death but also in impairment of
      neurogenesis. This article will review recently identified pathological
      mechanisms which potentially contribute to the development of neurocognitive
      impairment and dementia in association with HIV-1 infection.

TI  - Circulating interleukin-15 in dementia disorders.
PG  - 318-25
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the role of interleukin-15 (IL-15) as a
      potential marker of immune reactions in patients with Alzheimer's disease and
      vascular dementia. The authors measured by immunoassay serum IL-15 levels in 20
      patients with Alzheimer's disease and 15 patients with vascular dementia and
      compared them with serum IL-15 levels in 15 healthy subjects. The authors also
      studied the effect of treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) on
      serum IL-15 levels. Patients with Alzheimer's disease were found to have
      significantly lower serum IL-15 levels compared with healthy subjects and
      patients with vascular dementia. Healthy subjects and patients with vascular
      dementia did not differ between each other. Age, sex, disease duration, and
      Mini-Mental State Examination score did not affect IL-15 levels in any of the
      groups. Treatment with AChEI had no influence on IL-15 concentrations. The
      findings suggest that IL-15 is not implicated in the pathogenetic mechanisms of
      Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. An immune hyporesponsiveness at some
      point during disease development may be responsible for the lower levels of IL-15
      and other cytokines in Alzheimer's disease patients.

TI  - [Neuropsychiatric manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus].
PG  - 322-5
AB  - Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) has become a popular term
      designing all neurological and psychiatric complications in patients with
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It occurs in up to two thirds of all SLE
      patients and it covers a vast array of disorders ranging from peripheral
      neuropathy to stroke, psychosis, and dementia. Mechanisms associated with the
      pathogenesis of NPSLE include anti-neuronal antibodies, antiphospholipid antibody
      associated thrombosis, emboli from cardiac source and, rarely, vasculitis by
      immune complex depositions. Although the most common manifestations is cognitive 
      dysfunction (50%), NPSLE may also present itself as peripheral neuropathy (15%), 
      psychosis (10%), or other central nervous system abnormalities (stroke, organic
      brain syndrome, seizures). In lupus patients, one should always look for
      secondary causes of the neuropsychiatric manifestation, including infection,
      toxic metabolic abnormalities, and hypertension. We present two cases of SLE,
      which developed neuropsychiatric manifestations.

TI  - C-reactive protein and rate of dementia in carriers and non carriers of Apolipoprotein APOE4 genotype.
PG  - 1774-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Those with an Apolipoprotein APOE4 allele (APOE4) have lower
      C-reactive protein (CRP) than those without APOE4. Whether APOE4 modifies the
      effects of CRP on rate of all cause dementia, cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) is not established. METHODS: All cause dementia and cognitive
      impairment without dementia (CIND) was determined over five follow up visits from
      1998 to 2006 in an ongoing cohort of older Latinos. The association between high 
      sensitivity CRP and dementia/CIND, all cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease by 
      APOE4 status was examined in semi-parametric survival models with covariate
      adjustments. RESULTS: CRP was significantly lower among those with APOE4 than in 
      those without. Among those with APOE4, CRP was associated with lower rates of
      combined dementia/CIND (HR: 0.60, 95% CL: 0.20-0.91, p=0.03) from a fully
      adjusted model. Among those with no APOE4, there was no effect of CRP on
      dementia/CIND rates (HR: 0.94, 95% CL: 0.67-1.33). CONCLUSIONS: Lower CRP in
      those with APOE4 may reflect immune effects of the APOE4 genotype. Higher CRP in 
      those with APOE4 may be a marker of better immune function, leading to lower rate
      of dementia and AD.

TI  - TRPM7 and TRPM2-Candidate susceptibility genes for Western Pacific ALS and PD?
PG  - 822-35
AB  - Recent findings implicating TRPM7 and TRPM2 in oxidative stress-induced neuronal 
      death thrust these channels into the spotlight as possible therapeutic targets
      for neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we describe how the functional
      properties of TRPM7 and TRPM2 are interconnected with calcium (Ca(2+)) and
      magnesium (Mg(2+)) homeostasis, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and 
      immune mechanisms, all principal suspects in neurodegeneration. We focus our
      discussion on Western Pacific Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and
      Parkinsonism Dementia (PD) because extensive studies conducted over the years
      strongly suggest that these diseases are ideal candidates for a gene-environment 
      model of etiology. The unique mineral environment identified in connection with
      Western Pacific ALS and PD, low Mg(2+) and Ca(2+), yet high in transition metals,
      creates a condition that could affect the proper function of these two channels.

TI  - Immune complexes of auto-antibodies against A beta 1-42 peptides patrol cerebrospinal fluid of non-Alzheimer's patients.
PG  - 601-10
AB  - The diagnostic potential of large A beta-peptide binding particles (LAPs) in the 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) patients and non-AD
      controls (nAD) was evaluated. LAPs were detected by confocal spectroscopy in both
      groups with high inter-individual variation in number. Molecular imaging by
      confocal microscopy revealed that LAPs are heterogeneous superaggregates that
      could be subdivided morphologically into four main types (LAP 1-4). LAP-4 type,
      resembling a 'large chain of pearls', was detected in 42.1% of all nAD controls
      but it was virtually absent in AD patients. LAP-4 type could be selectively
      removed by protein A beads, a clear indication that it contained immunoglobulins 
      in addition to beta-amyloid peptides (A beta 1-42). We observed a close
      correlation between LAPs and immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration in CSF in
      controls but not in AD patients. Double labeling of LAPs with anti-A beta and
      anti-IgG antibodies confirmed that LAP-4 type consisted of A beta and IgG
      aggregates. Our results assign a central role to the immune system in regulating 
      A beta1-42 homeostasis by clustering this peptide in immunocomplexes.

TI  - Markedly increased vitamin B12 concentrations attributable to IgG-IgM-vitamin B12 immune complexes.
PG  - 2107-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: High serum vitamin B12 concentrations have been reported in patients 
      with hepatic disease, disseminated neoplasia, myeloproliferative disorders, and
      hypereosinophilic syndromes. We recently discovered an extraordinarily increased 
      vitamin B12 concentration in a patient without these underlying conditions.
      METHODS: Affinity and size-exclusion chromatography, sodium dodecyl
      sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), matrix-assisted laser
      desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and ELISA 
      methods were used to determine the cause of the increased vitamin B12
      concentrations in this patient's serum. RESULTS: The protein G column eluates
      from 2 apparently healthy volunteers and 2 patients with recent vitamin B12
      treatment for anemia had vitamin B12 concentrations of <74 pmol/L, whereas the
      vitamin B12 concentration in the protein G column eluate from the patient was
      7380 pmol/L. The elution profile from size-exclusion chromatography of vitamin
      B12-binding proteins in the patient's serum revealed an abnormal
      vitamin-B12-binding protein. SDS-PAGE analysis of the concentrated eluates from
      the protein G column, under reducing conditions, revealed an additional band with
      an apparent molecular mass of 76 kDa, which was not present in control column
      eluates. MALDI-TOF MS identified this band as an IgM heavy chain. By use of a
      modified ELISA, we determined that the IgM present in the patient's eluates was
      associated with the IgG to form IgG-IgM immune complexes. CONCLUSIONS: This case 
      demonstrates the unusual circumstance of a patient with markedly increased
      vitamin B12 concentrations attributed to immune complexes composed of IgG, IgM,
      and vitamin B12 and illustrates techniques that can be used to identify this
      occurrence.

TI  - Analysis of serum of patients with Alzheimer's disease for the level of advanced glycation end products.
PG  - 360-5
AB  - Data on the serum level of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) patients are scarce, although a specific biochemical marker easy to 
      detect in body fluids is desired for an early diagnosis of disease and to monitor
      the effects of therapeutic treatment. In the current study, the content of AGEs
      was examined with an immunochemical assay in the sera of AD patients, in the
      frame of a search for a biochemical marker of disease. Subjects with AD and
      vascular dementia (VaD) were included in the study (n = 30; age range, 68-70
      years). The results were compared to the healthy control groups. The
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) inhibition test for the determination
      of AGEs is based on a rabbit anti-AGE, affinity-purified antibody and a model
      AGE-myoglobin antigen, in which a serum sample treated with proteinase K is used 
      as an inhibitor. For the measurement of immune complexes and anti-AGE antibodies,
      the corresponding ELISA tests have been applied. The AGE level in the VaD group
      (49.5 U(AGE)) was higher than in AD patients (46.1 U(AGE)). The level of total
      AGEs in the sera of AD patients was significantly lower than in the control group
      (50/51.6 U(AGE)). These relations were not observed with regard to the immune
      complexes and anti-AGE antibody levels in AD (70.2 U(IC)/0.027 U(IgG)) and VaD
      (83 U(IC)/0.034 U(IgG)) patients because the levels of these parameters were
      similar to the controls (76.2 U(IC)/0.042 U(IgG)). The work revealed the lower
      level of circulating serum AGEs in patients with AD in relation to healthy
      controls.

TI  - Inflammatory changes parallel the early stages of Alzheimer disease.
PG  - 1821-33
AB  - Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most prominent cause of dementia in the elderly. To
      determine changes in the AD brain that may mediate the transition into dementia, 
      the gene expression of approximately 10,000 full-length genes was compared in
      mild/moderate dementia cases to non-demented controls that exhibited high AD
      pathology. Including this latter group distinguishes this work from previous
      studies in that it allows analysis of early cognitive loss. Compared to
      non-demented high-pathology controls, the hippocampus of AD cases with
      mild/moderate dementia had increased gene expression of the inflammatory molecule
      major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, as assessed with microarray analysis. 
      MHC II protein levels were also increased and inversely correlated with cognitive
      ability. Interestingly, the mild/moderate AD dementia cases also exhibited
      decreased number of T cells in the hippocampus and the cortex compared to
      controls. In conclusion, transition into AD dementia correlates with increased
      MHC II(+) microglia-mediated immunity and is paradoxically paralleled by a
      decrease in T cell number, suggesting immune dysfunction.

TI  - Homocysteine but not neopterin declines in demented patients on B vitamins.
PG  - 1815-9
AB  - Inflammation and immune system activation seem to play an important role in the
      development and progression of dementia. Hyperhomocysteinemia is common in
      various forms of dementia, and a significant relationship was found between
      concentrations of homocysteine and immune activation marker neopterin. B vitamin 
      supplementation is able to slow-down homocysteine formation in patients. In an
      open-label study, effects of B vitamin supplementation (Beneuran compositum ) on 
      concentrations of homocysteine and neopterin were investigated in 58 patients
      with Alzheimer's disease (n=30), vascular dementia (n=12) and mild cognitive
      impairment (n=16). In all groups of patients, a significant percentage of
      patients presented with homocysteine concentrations >15 micromol/L and with
      elevated concentrations of immune activation marker neopterin. Decline of
      homocysteine concentrations was observed after one month of B vitamin
      supplementation (all p<0.01; paired Kruskal-Wallisn-test). By contrast, neopterin
      concentrations remained unchanged (all p>0.05). B vitamin supplementation in
      patients with various forms of dementia did not influence neopterin
      concentrations, which indicates that the degree of immune activation and
      inflammation remained unchanged. The question remains, if lowering of
      homocysteine by folate supplementation alone could have any beneficial effect to 
      modulate the course of dementia development and if longer period of
      supplementation would also ameliorate immune system activation status.

TI  - Changes in the immune system in depression and dementia: causal or coincidental effects?
PG  - 163-74
AB  - Epidemiological studies show that there is a correlation between chronic
      depression and the likelihood of dementia in later life. There is evidence that
      inflammatory changes in the brain are pathological features of both depression
      and dementia. This suggests that an increase in inflammation-induced apoptosis,
      together with a reduction in the synthesis of neurotrophic factors caused by a
      rise in brain glucocorticoids, may play a role in the pathology of these
      disorders. A reduction in the neuroprotective components of the kynurenine
      pathway such as kynurenic acid, and an increase in the neurodegenerative
      components, 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid, contribute to the
      pathological changes. Such changes are postulated to cause neuronal damage, and
      thereby predispose chronically depressed patients to dementia.

TI  - In vivo evidence for microglial activation in neurodegenerative dementia.
PG  - 107-14
AB  - Evidence from numerous neuropathological observations and in vivo clinical
      imaging studies suggests a prominent role of activated microglia, the main
      effector cell of the brain's innate immune system, in Alzheimer's disease and
      other neurodegenerative diseases. Though the comprehensive molecular definition
      of the microglial activation process is still incomplete, the de novo expression 
      of 'peripheral benzodiazepine-binding sites (PBBS)' by activated but not resting 
      microglia has been established as a useful descriptor of functional state changes
      in microglia. As microglial transformation to an activated state is closely
      linked to progressive changes in brain disease, the detection of activated
      microglia can provide information about disease distribution and rate of disease 
      progression. Positron emission tomography (PET) and [(11)C](R)-PK11195, a
      specific ligand of the PBBS, have been used to study systematically microglial
      activation in vivo. Significant microglial activation is present in the brains of
      patients with neurodegenerative dementia even at early and possibly preclinical
      stages of the disease with a spatial distribution reflecting different clinical
      phenotypes. We review some of the posited functions of activated microglia in the
      pathophysiology of dementia and speculate on the relationship between increased
      regional [(11)C](R)-PK11195 signals and the ensuing changes in brain volume.
      Finally, we provide a brief outlook on the development of new radioligands for
      the PBBS.

TI  - Interleukin-12 is reduced in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.
PG  - 110-4
AB  - UNLABELLED: Interleukin-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine produced by activated
      blood monocytes, macrophages and glial cells. It enhances differentiation and
      proliferation of T cells and increases production of proinflammatory cytokines,
      such as Interferon-gamma and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha. There is little
      information about the involvement of IL-12 in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) and other tauopathies. OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to
      assess the role of IL-12 as a potential marker of immune reactions in patients
      with AD and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We measured by
      immunoassay cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-12 levels in 19 patients with AD and 7
      patients with FTD in comparison with CSF IL-12 levels in 30 patients with
      non-inflammatory neurological diseases served as neurological control patients
      (NCTRL). IL-12 levels were correlated with age, age of disease onset, disease
      duration, MMSE score, and rate of dementia progression. Abeta42 and Total tau
      (tau(T)) levels in CSF were also measured. RESULTS: Patients with AD had
      significantly lower CSF IL-12 levels compared with NCTRL patients (p<0.001).
      Patients with FTD had also lower CSF IL-12 levels compared with NCTRL patients
      (p<0.05). Age, sex, disease duration and MMSE score did not affect IL-12 levels
      in any of the groups. In AD a significant positive correlation was noted between 
      IL-12 levels and tau(T) levels (Rs=0.46, p=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may 
      suggest a reduced inflammatory reaction during the course of AD and FTD. A
      neurotrophic role of IL-12 and other proinflammatory cytokines cannot be
      excluded.

TI  - [Correlation between the presence of type-2 anti-pemphigoid antibodies and dementia in elderly subjects with no clinical signs of pemphigoid].
PG  - 439-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pemphigoid is a form of auto-immune bullous dermatosis characterised 
      by the production of antibodies directed against components of hemidesmosomes in 
      the basal membrane. The physiopathological process responsible for unmasking of
      these antigens is unknown. Pemphigoid is more common in elderly subjects and is
      most often seen in debilitated subjects. The prevalence of pemphigoid
      anti-pemphigoid antibodies (anti-PB) is not known in the elderly population
      presenting no dermatological signs evocative of the disease. We studied the
      prevalence of anti-PBAg2 antibodies in elderly subjects with no signs of
      pemphigoid as well as in the correlation between the presence of these antibodies
      and diagnosis of dementia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Elderly subjects (aged over 69
      years) with no signs of pemphigoid were recruited consecutively in dermatology
      and geriatrics departments (138 subjects). Details of concomitant medication were
      recorded for all subjects and clinical examination was performed with calculation
      of MMS (Mini Mental Score). The subjects were then divided into two groups based 
      on MMS score. The first group comprised subjects without dementia (MMS > 24)
      while the second comprised subjects with dementia. Serum anti-PBAg2 antibodies
      were determined by ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence with confirmation by
      Western blot. Antinuclear antibodies, used as a control for non-specific immune
      response, were assayed in all serum samples. The prevalence of these antibodies
      was compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable in
      terms of age, sex and presence of dermatological diseases (ulcers, bedsores,
      erysipelas). Each group comprised 69 subjects. The overall presence of anti-PBAg2
      antibodies in subjects with no signs are suggestive of pemphigoid was 3.6%.
      Presence of anti-PBAg2 antibodies was associated with diagnosis of dementia
      (p=0.04; 0% and 7% in groups 1 and 2, respectively). No correlation was seen
      between the presence of anti-PBAg2 antibodies and concomitant medication or
      dermatological disease. The overall prevalence of antinuclear antibodies was
      14.5% and the figure was similar between the two groups. DISCUSSION: The presence
      of anti-PBAg2 could be associated with the diagnosis of dementia in elderly
      subjects.

TI  - Immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.
PG  - 720-5
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this article is to review the role of immunotherapy
      in the removal of proteins which accumulate abnormally in neurodegenerative
      disorders associated with dementia, in particular amyloid-beta accumulation in
      Alzheimer's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: In both transgenic mouse models and in two 
      trials of amyloid-beta immunotherapy for human Alzheimer's disease, active
      immunization with amyloid-beta 1-42 results in the removal of amyloid-beta
      plaques from the cerebral cortex associated with, in the mouse models,
      improvement in cognitive function. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy and
      neurofibrillary tangles persist, however, and there is also concern about T
      lymphocyte immune reactions in the meninges in the human cases. Active
      immunization schedules are being developed to minimize T lymphocyte reactions and
      to maximize antibody production and passive immunization protocols are being
      devised. Immunotherapy for removal of the proteins which accumulate in other
      neurodegenerative disorders associated with dementia such as prion proteins and
      alpha-synuclein are in the early stages of development. SUMMARY: Dementias in the
      elderly are an increasing medical, social and economic problem and current
      treatments are only effective. In the majority of dementias, proteins accumulate 
      within cells and in the extracellular compartments of the brain. In the most
      common dementia, Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-beta accumulates as plaques in the 
      extracellular space of the grey matter and in artery walls as cerebral amyloid
      angiopathy and tau protein accumulates as neurofibrillary tangles within neurons.

TI  - Association of AIDS and bipolar mania with rapid progression to dementia and death.
PG  - 92-5
AB  - Neuropsychiatric complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or
      acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) may present clinically as acute or
      chronic organic brain syndrome, or mimic functional psychiatric diseases. Among
      such psychiatric diseases, mania tends to occur with increased frequency after
      the onset of AIDS. We report a case in which manic manifestations were noted
      before the diagnosis of AIDS. The patient had no past or family history of mood
      disorders, but had risk factors for HIV infection. He had a rapid downhill course
      from initial manic symptoms to depression, dementia and then death within 10
      months. Such rapid cognitive deterioration into AIDS dementia after mania is
      consistent with previous reports. Cases like this will become more common with
      spread of the AIDS pandemic in Asian regions, including Taiwan. Clinicians should
      be mindful of HIV infection/AIDS as a differential diagnosis in patients with
      manic episodes and risk factors for HIV infection.

PG  - 314-22
AB  - Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy
      (PLOSL) is a recessively inherited disease characterized by early onset dementia 
      associated with bone cysts. Our group has recently established the molecular
      background of PLOSL by identifying mutations in DAP12 and TREM2 genes. To
      understand how loss of function of the immune cell activating DAP12/TREM2
      signaling complex leads to dementia and loss of myelin, we have analyzed here
      Dap12 and Trem2 expression in the mouse CNS. We show that Dap12 and Trem2 are
      expressed from embryonic stage to adulthood, and demonstrate a highly similar
      expression pattern. In addition, we identify microglial cells and
      oligodendrocytes as the major Dap12/Trem2-producing cells in the CNS and,
      consequently, as the predominant cell types involved in PLOSL pathogenesis. These
      findings provide a good starting point for the study of the molecular mechanisms 
      of this inherited dementia and new evidence for the involvement of the immune
      system in neuronal degeneration.

TI  - Alcohol consumption: an overview of benefits and risks.
PG  - 664-72
AB  - Published health benefits of regular light-to-moderate alcohol consumption
      include lower myocardial infarction rates, reduced heart failure rates, reduced
      risk of ischemic stroke, lower risk for dementia, decreased risk of diabetes and 
      reduced risk of osteoporosis. Numerous complimentary biochemical changes have
      been identified that explain the beneficial effects of moderate alcohol
      consumption. Heavy alcohol consumption, however, can negatively affect
      neurologic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hematologic, immune, psychiatric and
      musculoskeletal organ systems. Binge drinking is a significant problem even among
      moderate drinkers and is associated with particularly high social and economic
      costs. A cautious approach should be emphasized for those individuals who drink
      even small amounts of alcohol. Physicians can apply the research evidence
      describing the known risks and benefits of alcohol consumption when counseling
      their patients regarding alcohol consumption.

TI  - The prevalence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF of patients with primary neurodegenerative dementia.
PG  - 184-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines from the United States and Europe on the diagnosis 
      and management of dementia include advice that younger patients with dementia
      should undergo CSF examination, which frequently includes analysis for
      oligoclonal bands (OCB). The presence of CNS specific OCB has traditionally been 
      considered suggestive of an inflammatory aetiology, although the interpretation
      of such a finding in the presence of a normal CSF white cell count and protein is
      more difficult. METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the prevalence of OCB,
      determined using agarose isoelectric focusing, in a series of 131 well
      characterised patients with a final diagnosis of a degenerative dementia who had 
      undergone CSF examination. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 60.0 (SD
      8.4) years. Seventy (53%) patients had Alzheimer's disease (AD), forty seven (36 
      %) had frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), seven (5%) had Dementia with
      Lewy bodies and the remaining seven (5%) patients had other rarer
      neurodegenerative dementias. Neuropathological examination had been performed in 
      fifteen (11%) patients. CNS specific OCB were present in nine (7%) patients in
      this cohort, all of whom had normal CSF white cell counts: four AD patients (a
      prevalence of 6%), four FTLD patients (a prevalence of 9%), and one patient with 
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (a prevalence of 25%). Investigation of these patients,
      including two with neuropathologically verified AD and one with post-mortem
      confirmed CJD, did not reveal an alternative aetiology for their dementia.
      CONCLUSION: A central immune response can occur in primary neurodegenerative
      dementias, albeit uncommonly.

TI  - APOE genotype-specific differences in human and mouse macrophage nitric oxide production.
PG  - 62-7
AB  - Individuals expressing an APOE4 genotype demonstrate increased Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) neuropathology and a decreased onset age. The APOE4 gene may act by 
      modulating the CNS immune response. Using human monocyte-derived macrophages
      (MDM), we show a significantly greater increase in NO production during immune
      activation in MDM from APOE4 AD patients compared to normal, age-matched
      individuals or to AD patients with an APOE 3/3 genotype. Microglia and peritoneal
      macrophages from APOE4 targeted replacement mice demonstrate a similar increase
      in NO compared to the APOE3 targeted replacement mice. The enhanced macrophage
      responsiveness and the increased production of NO in APOE4 AD patients may
      predispose the CNS to an increased potential for nitration and nitrosation,
      consistent with the redox imbalance and neuroinflammatory state seen in AD.

TI  - Hyperhomocysteinemia and immune activation.
PG  - 1438-43
AB  - Hyperhomocysteinemia is an established risk factor for atherosclerosis,
      thrombosis and other vascular diseases. Homocysteine auto-oxidation is considered
      to be crucially involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. However, the
      question remains to be elucidated whether vitamin deficiency and homocysteine
      accumulation are causal for disease development or rather comprise a secondary
      phenomenon. Most diseases accompanied by hyperhomocysteinemia are also associated
      with ongoing activation of the immune system. In vitro experiments show
      homocysteine to accumulate in stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In
      patients with coronary heart disease, with rheumatoid arthritis and in patients
      with dementia, an association between cellular immune activation and homocysteine
      metabolism is found. Homocysteine concentrations not only correlate inversely
      with folate concentrations, they also show a positive relationship with
      concentrations of immune activation markers like neopterin. Moreover, in patients
      with various kinds of dementia, increased concentrations of serum peroxides,
      homocysteine and neopterin correlate with each other. Studies support a role of
      immune system activation in the development of hyperhomocysteinemia. Stimulation 
      and proliferation of immune cells may lead to the production of reactive oxygen
      species that may oxidize antioxidants and oxidation-sensitive B-vitamins. An
      enhanced demand for antioxidants as well as folate and vitamin B12 may develop,
      together with hyperhomocysteinemia, despite sufficient dietary intake.

TI  - Serum markers of monocyte/macrophage activation in patients with Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia.
PG  - 553-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recently an increase in serum neopterin has been described in
      patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) that would be associated with an increased
      cell-mediated immune response. We have studied the serum levels of several
      monocyte/macrophage activation markers in patients with AD and other types of
      dementia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum neopterin concentration, and the
      chitotriosidase (ChT), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and adenosine
      deaminase (ADA) activities were determined in 30 patients with AD, in 19 patients
      with other types of dementia, and in 24 nonaffected controls. RESULTS: Neopterin 
      concentration was significantly higher in the subgroup of AD patients with a
      global deterioration scale higher than in the other patients with AD, patients
      with other types of dementia and in the control group (p < 0.005). However, the
      activities of ChT, ACE and ADA, despite having a significant correlation with
      neopterin, did not present any statistically significant differences among the
      groups studied. CONCLUSION: In the most advanced clinical stages of AD, as well
      as an increased immune activation, an impaired formation of tetrahydrobiopterin
      from dehydroneopterin triphosphate would contribute to an increase in the serum
      concentration of neopterin. However, the large overlap between the groups, limits
      the possible clinical value of serum neopterin in AD patients.

TI  - Brain immune responses cognitive decline and dementia: relationship with phenotype expression and genetic background.
PG  - 539-48
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain and
      the most frequent cause of dementia among elderly. The etiology of AD is still
      obscure, but genetic and environmental factors appear to play differential roles 
      in the disease. Several evidence suggest that inflammation or altered immune
      responses may play an important role in this disease. The following topics will
      be discussed: (1) the association of inflammation with brain degenerative
      processes in AD; (2) the influence of cytokine gene polymorphism upon the risk of
      developing AD and/or the age at onset of manifestation clinical dementia; (3) the
      effects of gene allele variations upon the phenotype of immune molecules in the
      blood and brain of AD patients; (4) the association of genetic variations in some
      of this molecules with the progression of the disease and cognitive decline.

TI  - Severity of gliosis in Pick's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration: tau-positive glia differentiate these disorders.
PG  - 827-40
AB  - Frontotemporal dementia is a term used to characterize diverse neuropathological 
      conditions that can present with the same clinical phenotype. Five different
      neuropathologies underlie this disorder. However, consistent frontal and/or
      temporal neuronal loss and gliosis characterize all cases, the majority having no
      obvious pathological inclusions. Because neuronal loss and gliosis are consistent
      features across all cases, the present study aimed to determine the relationship 
      between neuronal loss, gliosis and, for cases with abnormal tau inclusions,
      intracellular tau deposition. Formalin-fixed brain specimens from sporadic cases 
      with frontotemporal dementia (eight with tau-positive Pick bodies, five with
      frontotemporal lobar degeneration without inclusions) were compared with those
      from non-diseased controls (n = 5). Brain specimens were cut into 3 mm coronal
      slices for evaluation and tissue samples from the superior frontal gyrus were
      taken for microscopic analysis. Immuno histochemistry for glia-specific proteins 
      (astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein and microglial major
      histocompatibility complex II) and different tau epitopes was performed on 50
      microm free-floating sections. Gross patterns of brain atrophy were analysed and 
      upper and lower layer pyramidal neurons and glial cell numbers were quantified. A
      disease severity scheme was devised using the degree of gross macroscopic frontal
      and temporal atrophy to establish the relationship between the gliosis and
      neurodegeneration. In this small sample, the patterns of gross atrophy could be
      grouped reliably into four stages of severity. These stages were the same across 
      disease groups and correlated with volume- corrected pyramidal neuron densities. 
      In cases with Pick bodies, disease stage also correlated with duration, providing
      further evidence that these stages represent the progression of degeneration in
      this limited sample. Whereas there were, on average, many more reactive
      astrocytes in the cases with Pick bodies than in those with frontotemporal lobar 
      atrophy, there was significant overlap between cases in the degree of
      astrocytosis. However, a large proportion of the astrocytes in Pick's disease
      displayed phosphorylated tau immunoreactivity, whereas no tau-positive astrocytes
      were found in frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The pattern and degree of
      microglia activation were similar in all the dementia cases analysed, with
      considerably more activated microglia accumulating in white matter. In this small
      sample, the abundance of white matter microglia at early disease stages suggests 
      a prominent role for this cell type in the neurodegenerative process. In
      frontotemporal lobar degeneration, a significant proportion of the activated
      white matter microglia were tau-2-immunoreactive, suggesting direct involvement
      in axonal degeneration, possibly via immune processes.

TI  - Ageing and infection.
PG  - 659-66
AB  - Average life expectancy throughout developed countries has rapidly increased
      during the latter half of the 20th century and geriatric infectious diseases have
      become an increasingly important issue. Infections in the elderly are not only
      more frequent and more severe, but they also have distinct features with respect 
      to clinical presentation, laboratory results, microbial epidemiology, treatment, 
      and infection control. Reasons for increased susceptibility include
      epidemiological elements, immunosenescence, and malnutrition, as well as a large 
      number of age-associated physiological and anatomical alterations. Moreover,
      ageing may be the cause of infection but infection can also be the cause of
      ageing. Mechanisms may include enhanced inflammation, pathogen-dependent tissue
      destruction, or accelerated cellular ageing through increased turnover. In most
      instances, treatment of infection leads to a satisfactory outcome in the elderly.
      However, in palliative care situations and in patients with terminal dementia,
      the decision whether or not to treat an infectious disease is becoming a
      difficult ethical issue.

TI  - Enteral feeding.
PG  - 695-8
AB  - In this review, topics with scientific strength, topical interest, and
      controversy were selected. Over the past 50 years, malnutrition has become
      increasingly recognized as a cause of increased morbidity and mortality in
      hospital patients. From 1970 to 1980, parenteral nutrition was advocated as the
      most appropriate form of nutritional therapy for hospital patients. Since then,
      parenteral nutrition has been replaced by enteral nutrition as the best way of
      delivering nutrients to hospital patients. The timing of enteral nutrition has
      been debated. Should it be instituted early, within the first 24 hours? In
      addition, enteral nutrition containing immune-enhancing nutrients such as
      arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, glutamine, and nucleotides has been advocated for 
      critically ill patients. The relative merits of enteral versus total parenteral
      nutrition continue to be debated. Questions about possible complications related 
      to enteral nutrition have been raised. Patients are at risk of nosocomial
      pneumonia from aspiration and at risk of bowel ischemia because enteral nutrition
      increases intestinal oxygen consumption. Steroids are often used to treat Crohn
      disease, but because of undesirable side effects, various techniques have been
      used to reduce steroid dependency. Enteral nutrition has been advocated as a way 
      of reducing steroid dependency. Finally, enteral nutrition is routinely used to
      feed demented patients and those in a vegetative state. It is not clear whether
      this practice alters outcome or quality of life.

TI  - A pilot study of immune and mood outcomes of a community-based intervention for dementia caregivers: the PLST intervention.
PG  - 156-67
AB  - Providing care to a family member with dementia is conceptualized as a chronic
      stressor with adverse psychological and physical effects. The purpose of this
      pilot study was to evaluate mood and immune outcomes of caregivers exposed to a
      community-based psychoeducational nursing intervention based on the progressively
      lowered stress threshold (PLST) model. The PLST intervention is designed to
      strengthen the psychological resources of dementia caregivers by teaching methods
      of preventing and/or managing behavioral problems exhibited by the person with
      dementia. Mood and immune outcomes were compared between caregivers randomly
      assigned to receive either the PLST or a comparison intervention. Results of this
      pilot study suggest that caregivers who received the PLST intervention showed
      significantly stronger T-cell proliferative responses to both PHA and ConA,
      indicating an improvement in T-cell immune function immediately after the in-home
      intervention (T2) and again after 6 months of telephone support for application
      of the PLST model (T3). Findings do not support the hypothesis that the PLST
      intervention had a significant effect on total mood disturbance or natural killer
      cell cytotoxicity over the course of the study.

TI  - The use of antioxidants in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies: a case report.
PG  - 22-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), which include
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, are diseases
      characterized by progressive deterioration in the central nervous system with
      neuronal degeneration, vacuolatization of the neuropil, and gliosis. Little is
      known about the pathogenic mechanisms of infection, and controversy exits around 
      the inciting infective agent. It has been shown that an important factor in
      pathogenesis is the immune system. CASE: The reported case points to beneficial
      effects when antioxidant therapies are used in transmissible spongiform
      encephalopathies. The case revealed an early reversal in cognitive decline and
      subsequent improvements in myoclonus, apnea and rigidity. Although death was the 
      ultimate outcome, the patient succumbed to the illness over 22 months after the
      onset of symptoms when the early rapid decline predicted demise within a few
      months. CONCLUSION: It is possible that strategies blocking the effect of
      proinflammatory cytokines and the resulting oxidative damage may stem the
      progressive damage to the neuropil that occurs in spongiform encephalopathies.
      Further investigation into the use of antioxidants and other types of agents
      quelling inflammation needs to be undertaken. If antioxidants could be combined
      with treatments for the inciting infective agent, a new direction could be taken 
      in the outcome of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies including CJD and
      vCJD.

TI  - Changes in plasma nerve growth factor levels in older adults associated with chronic stress.
PG  - 102-6
AB  - Evidence indicates that the actions of nerve growth factor (NGF) reach beyond the
      nervous system and might modulate immune function. Based on reports that blood
      NGF rises following the acute stress of parachute jumping, we investigated
      whether exposure to a chronic stressor, caregiving for a cognitively impaired
      spouse, could alter the levels of blood NGF. High perceived stress and depression
      in caregivers (vs. well-matched controls) were associated with elevated blood
      NGF. These data suggest that exposure to this chronic stressor can alter the
      concentrations of circulating NGF, and that psychological stress can induce
      changes in NGF concentrations in older adults.

TI  - Activation mechanism of brain microglia in patients with diffuse neurofibrillary tangles with calcification: a comparison with Alzheimer disease.
PG  - 45-50
AB  - Diffuse neurofibrillary tangles with calcification (DNTC) is an atypical dementia
      and is characterized pathologically by diffuse neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)
      without senile plaques (SPs). In this study, we investigated the distribution of 
      human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR-positive activated microglia in postmortem brain
      tissue of six patients with DNTC and six patients with Alzheimer disease (AD).
      HLA-DR-positive activated microglia were observed to associate with SPs in AD. In
      the DNTC brain, which lacks SPs, HLA-DR-positive microglia were mainly
      accumulated around weakly tau-positive NFTs, which were also positive for
      anti-amyloid-P and anti-C3d antibodies. The results of this study suggest that
      the complement pathway is also activated in the DNTC brain and that immune and
      inflammatory responses, including microglia activation, may occur around
      extracellular NFTs in DNTC patients.

TI  - Vulnerability to health problems in female informal caregivers of persons with HIV/AIDS and age-related dementias.
PG  - 60-8
AB  - The health of informal caregivers is often studied from the perspective of
      caregivers' and care receivers' personal and interpersonal characteristics. This 
      study offers an alternative explanation based on a vulnerable populations
      framework and considers the role of resource availability to the health status of
      informal caregivers (n=76). Caregivers in a convenience sample were females of
      diverse ethnicity and socioeconomic status, and care recipients were diagnosed
      with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) 
      or age-related dementias (ARD). Personal interviews using structured instruments 
      were conducted with caregivers who were attending outpatient clinics at a public 
      hospital and a VA hospital. Instruments included the Center for Epidemiologic
      Studies Depression-Scale (CES-D), the Global Health Assessment (GHA), the
      Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADL), the Memory and Behavior Problems
      Checklist (MBPC) and items from the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) measuring
      anger, anxiety and loneliness. Caregivers were experiencing both physical and
      mental health problems. Regression analyses were used to examine the
      relationships among resources available to caregivers, conditions that put
      caregivers at risk for poorer health, and health status itself. Analyses were
      conducted for each group of caregivers separately (HIV and ARD) and for the total
      group, using depressive symptoms and perception of physical health as dependent
      variables. In caregivers of people with HIV/AIDS (PWHIV), caregiver distress over
      care recipient symptoms, anxiety and education were related to depressive
      symptoms. Depressive symptoms, anger and functional status of the PWHIV were
      related to caregivers' perception of poorer physical health. In caregivers of
      people with ARD, there were no significant predictors for depressive symptoms or 
      perception of physical health. In the total group of caregivers, lower income and
      more anger were related to depressive symptom score. When perception of physical 
      health was the dependent variable, minority ethnicity and depressive mood were
      related to worse perception of physical health. These findings support the
      relationship of a lack of resources to health status. A community-based programme
      of resources and health care services for the caregiver-care receiver dyad is
      recommended.

TI  - Chronic stress in caregivers of dementia patients is associated with reduced lymphocyte sensitivity to glucocorticoids.
PG  - 84-92
AB  - Caring for the chronically ill is associated with chronic distress. In view of
      the adverse effects of distress on cellular immune function, such distress may
      have implications for health. Indeed, it has been proposed that the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a potential psychobiological
      mediator of these effects. In this study, we observed that elderly caregivers
      experienced greater distress and increased salivary cortisol than non-caregivers.
      In addition, caregivers had blunted mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation,
      lower mitogen-induced IL-2 production, and reduced lymphocyte sensitivity to
      glucocorticoids. These results indicate that chronic distress is associated with 
      impaired cell-mediated immunity which is, in turn, associated with elevated basal
      steroid levels and altered steroid immunoregulation at the level of the
      lymphocyte.

AB  - Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLAb) may cause both focal ischemic and diffuse
      brain damage and may be associated with dementia. We have examined the
      relationship of aPLAb to dementia in the elderly. Blood samples were obtained
      from 87 consecutive patients with dementia (74 +/- 11 years old) and 69 controls 
      (78 +/- 9 years old), residents of an old age home who were not overtly demented.
      Levels of aPLAb were measured by a standardized ELISA, utilizing cardiolipin as
      antigen, and we considered levels above 20 IgG antiphospholipid units (GPLU) as
      significantly elevated. We found that 5 of the 87 demented patients (6%), but
      none of the 69 controls, had significantly elevated aPLAb levels (p = 0.03,
      one-tailed Fisher's exact test). All the patients with high aPLAb levels were
      diagnosed clinically as having dementia of the Alzheimer type, except for 1 who
      had mixed dementia, and none had features of an immune-mediated disease. Thus, a 
      small but significant number of patients with dementia have high levels of aPLAb.
      The role of the aPLAb in these patients, with apparently diffuse brain disease,
      is currently unknown.

TI  - Depression, psychosis, and dementia: impact on the family.
PG  - S17-20
AB  - Similar to the setting of other chronic, debilitating diseases, considerable
      psychoeducational support of the patient's family and other caregivers represents
      an often-overlooked component of appropriately thorough care. Nearly three of
      four persons caring for an individual with PD report psychological stress and
      anxiety, which are exacerbated by concerns about progression of the disease.
      Counseling for PD caregivers can be dispensed particularly effectively through
      individual psychological counseling as well as PD support and community self-help
      groups that assist caregivers in sharing concerns and promote a sense they are
      understood by others. Through such measures, which may be delivered effectively
      by nurse practitioners, PD caregivers can develop effective coping strategies for
      disease related stressors. Empirical results show the most common stressors are: 
      anxiety, concern about the future, impatience or intolerance, loss of autonomy,
      sleep disturbances, diminished time and opportunity for recreation and social
      contact, and anger. These sequelae often ensue when the PD patient evidences
      depression, advanced dementia, or psychosis, each of which can severely constrain
      communication. Caregivers often must also contend with two other adverse
      psychological phenomena: cognitive dissonance surrounding placement of the
      patient in a nursing home and learned helplessness, which may predispose to
      depressive states. Other often unmet needs of the "hidden victims" of PD include 
      compromised immune function, social stigmata, and financial difficulties. Respite
      care may be useful in reducing the stress associated with these and other
      problems frequently affecting caregivers.

TI  - Chronic stress in elderly carers of dementia patients and antibody response to influenza vaccination.
PG  - 627-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are many reports of psychological morbidity in spousal carers
      of patients with dementia. The consequences of this increased stress on the
      immune system are unclear. We investigated whether antibody responses to
      influenza vaccination differed between carers and a control group, and the
      relation of the antibody response to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
      axis. METHODS: 50 spousal carers of dementia patients, median age 73 years (IQR
      66-77), and 67 controls (68 years [66-71]) of similar socioeconomic status were
      enrolled. Anxiety and depression were measured by the Savage Aged Personality
      Screening Scale and stress by the Global Measure of Perceived Stress scale.
      Principal-component analysis was used to yield a summary score of emotional
      distress from these two scales. Salivary cortisol concentrations were measured
      over a single day at three times (0800-1000, 1100-1300, and 2000-2200).
      Participants received a trivalent influenza vaccine and IgG antibody titres to
      each strain were measured on days 0, 7, 14, and 28. FINDINGS: Mean scores of
      emotional distress were significantly higher in carers at each time point than in
      controls (all p<0.0003). Mean (SD) salivary cortisol concentrations, calculated
      as area under the curve (AUC), were higher in carers than controls at all three
      assessments (6 months 16.0 [8.0] vs 11.2 [4.4], p=0.0001; respectively). Eight
      (16%) of 50 carers and 26 (39%) of 67 controls had a four-fold increase in at
      least one of the IgG titres (p=0.007). There was an inverse relation between AUC 
      cortisol and IgG antibody titre to the Nanchang strain that was significant on
      day 14 (r=-0.216, p=0.039). INTERPRETATION: Elderly carers of spouses with
      dementia have increased activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and
      a poor antibody response to influenza vaccine. Carers may be more vulnerable to
      infectious disease than the population of a similar age.

TI  - The neuronal RNA-binding protein Nova-2 is implicated as the autoantigen targeted in POMA patients with dementia.
PG  - 13254-9
AB  - Paraneoplastic opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia (POMA) is a neurologic disorder
      thought to be mediated by an autoimmune attack against onconeural disease
      antigens that are expressed by gynecologic or lung tumors and by neurons. One
      POMA disease antigen, termed Nova-1, has been identified as a neuron-specific
      KH-type RNA-binding protein. Nova-1 expression is restricted to specific regions 
      of the central nervous system, primarily the hindbrain and ventral spinal cord,
      which correlate with the predominantly motor symptoms in POMA. However, POMA
      antisera recognize antigens that are widely expressed in both caudal and rostral 
      regions of the central nervous system, and some patients develop cognitive
      symptoms. We have used POMA antisera to clone a cDNA encoding a second POMA
      disease antigen termed Nova-2. Nova-2 is closely related to Nova-1, and is
      expressed at high levels in neurons during development and in adulthood, and at
      lower levels in the adult lung. In the postnatal mouse brain, Nova-2 is expressed
      in a pattern that is largely reciprocal with Nova-1, including high levels of
      Nova-2 expression in the neocortex and hippocampus. Functional characterization
      of Nova-2 in RNA selection and nitrocellulose filter-binding assays reveals that 
      Nova-2 binds RNA with high affinity and with sequence specificity that differs
      from Nova-1. Our results demonstrate that the immune response in POMA targets a
      family of highly related sequence-specific neuronal RNA-binding proteins. The
      expression pattern of the Nova-2 protein is likely to underlie the development of
      cognitive deficits in some POMA patients.

TI  - Serum interleukin-6 levels correlate with the severity of dementia in Down syndrome and in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 236-40
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory processes are suspected in the pathomechanism of
      Alzheimer's dementia (AD) but the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of
      inflammatory cytokines are not yet determined in the different forms of the
      disorder. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were examined in the 
      sera and CSF of patients with mild-moderate and severe stage of late onset
      sporadic type of AD and in the sera of demented Down syndrome (DS) probands with 
      similar stages of AD and compared with data of age-matched healthy controls.
      RESULTS: Normal serum IL-6 levels were found in the mild-moderate stage, but
      significantly increased levels were found in the severe stage of both dementia
      groups. The CSF concentrations remained within the normal range in all groups.
      Positive correlations between the serum IL-6 levels and age and the severity of
      the disease were present. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a disease stage
      dependent general activation of the immune system both in sporadic AD and in DS
      with AD.

TI  - [Vaccination against hepatitis B possibly indicated for elderly institutionalized mentally handicapped persons with isolated anti-HBc positivity of the prevaccination serum].
PG  - 1694-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether vaccination against hepatitis B may be omitted in
      persons with isolated positive anti-HBc. DESIGN: Prospective study using control 
      groups. SETTING'S: Heeren Loo-Lozenoord, Ermelo, the Netherlands. METHOD:
      Twenty-six older residents (group P) with isolated anti-HBc positivity (HBsAg
      negative and anti-HBs < 10 IU/l) were given hepatitis B vaccine (3 doses); 16
      matched controls (group C1) lacking hepatitis B markers, received a primary
      vaccination (3 doses), 8 controls (group C2) with a immune status based on
      infection in the past received vaccination (3 doses) and 27 controls (group C3)
      were given a booster vaccination (1 dose) after vaccination 7 years earlier. The 
      anti-HBs response was measured 0, 1 and 7 months after the first vaccine dose. An
      anamnestic response was defined as a fourfold rise of anti-HBs after one dose of 
      vaccine or--in the absence of an anti-HBs titer in the prevaccination serum--a
      response > or = 10 IU/l after one dose of vaccine. A primary response was defined
      as an anti-HBs response > or = 10 IU/l after giving 3 vaccines, while the
      criteria for an anamnestic response were not met. RESULTS: In the isolated
      anti-HBc group (P) and in the corresponding control group (C2) 15 and 12.5%,
      respectively, showed an anamnestic response; the majority reacted with a primary 
      response or did not respond at all. The subjects given a primary vaccination (C1)
      responded in 62.5% with a primary response while those vaccinated earlier (C3)
      responded in 92.6% with a fourfold rise of anti-HBs. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-HBs
      response to vaccination in older mentally handicapped persons is delayed and
      there is a reduced chance of development of a protective anti-HBs titer. The
      majority of individuals with isolated anti-HBc showed a primary response. In
      these persons vaccination should not be omitted, especially if there is a risk of
      hepatitis B.

TI  - Chronic stress modulates the virus-specific immune response to latent herpes simplex virus type 1.
PG  - 78-82
AB  - We compared 71 family caregivers of dementia sufferers and 58 control subjects on
      three different immune measures relevant to latent herpes simplex virus Type 1
      (HSV-1) infection: neutralizing antibody titers, antibody titers to a total viral
      antigen, and a proliferative memory T-cell response. Caregivers had significantly
      higher antibody titers to the total viral antigen and a poorer HSV-1 specific
      T-cell response than controls, but no significant difference in neutralizing
      antibody titers between groups was observed. These data provide additional
      evidence that psychological stress can modulate a virus-specific immune response 
      associated with caregiving.

TI  - T lymphocyte benzodiazepine binding is reduced in demented patients.
PG  - 101-6
AB  - Blood cells, especially platelets and lymphocytes, are used in neuropsychiatric
      research as tools for investigating systemic derangements in neuropsychiatric
      disorders, and as peripheral models for studying central nervous system
      biochemistry. In the present work, we determined T lymphocyte peripheral-type
      benzodiazepine binding: a significant reduction of Bmax values was observed in
      demented patients as compared with healthy controls, whereas Kd values were
      similar in the two subjects' groups. A significant negative correlation was found
      between Bmax values and illness severity. These data, which seem to be related to
      an impairment of immune response and cell energy metabolism in demented patients,
      may represent a state-dependent marker in monitoring disease course and treatment
      efficacy.

TI  - Heller syndrome in a pre-school boy. Proposed medical evaluation and hypothesized pathogenesis.
PG  - 172-7
AB  - The case of a 6-year-old boy who developed childhood disintegrative disorder
      (Heller syndrome) at the age of 4 years is presented, and specifics of the
      neurologic evaluation are detailed. A table is provided suggesting the complete
      neurologic work-up with the potential findings for children presenting with signs
      and symptoms of deterioration. A hypothesis for the aetiology of Heller syndrome 
      proposes that predisposing genetic factors when combined with an environmental
      stress result in the deposition of amyloid and the disruption of synaptic
      transmission during the deterioration period. Speculation that the deterioration 
      may be self-limited by activation of an immune response is based upon earlier
      findings that interleukin 1 has been shown to be involved in the breakdown of
      amyloid precursor protein in humans.

TI  - Chronic stress alters the immune response to influenza virus vaccine in older adults.
PG  - 3043-7
AB  - To determine whether a chronic stressor (caregiving for a spouse with a
      progressive dementia) is associated with an impaired immune response to influenza
      virus vaccination, we compared 32 caregivers' vaccine responses with those of 32 
      sex-, age-, and socioeconomically matched control subjects. Caregivers showed a
      poorer antibody response following vaccination relative to control subjects as
      assessed by two independent methods, ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition.
      Caregivers also had lower levels of in vitro virus-specific-induced interleukin 2
      levels and interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6 did not differ between groups. These 
      data demonstrate that down-regulation of the immune response to influenza virus
      vaccination is associated with a chronic stressor in the elderly. These results
      could have implications for vulnerability to infection among older adults.

TI  - The diseases of Alzheimer and Pick from the viewpoint of prevention.
PG  - 180-2
AB  - Alzheimer disease, Pick disease and senile dementia are all characterized by
      similar morphological changes, both macroscopic and microscopic, and similar
      psychiatric symptoms. All three should, therefore, be viewed as aspects of one
      disease, which is termed Alzheimer-type dementia. Nothing contradicts the view
      that immune complexes take part in the etiology of Alzheimer-type dementia. There
      are various types of immune complexes and so their points of action in the
      organism may vary. There might be two main means of preventing Alzheimer-type
      dementia: the first could be named the serological (basic) and the second relying
      on pharmacotherapy (additional). Pharmacological prevention of disease might be
      aided by the use of parasympathomimetic drugs, e.g. pilocarpine.

TI  - [The neuroimmune relationships during normal aging and in Alzheimer-type dementias].
PG  - 32-9
AB  - Relationships between neurophysiological and immune parameters were studied in
      normal middle-aged and elderly subjects and in patients with dementia of
      Alzheimer's type (DAT). The rate of such interaction was minimal in normal aging,
      in DAT neuroimmune relations increased. The correlation between the immune
      parameters and the characteristics of components of visual evoked potentials and 
      auditory brain-stem responses suggests that in the middle-aged healthy subjects, 
      a primary role in neuroimmune relations belongs to limbicoreticular structures
      and to the mesencephalon. In normal aging, the influence of limbicoreticular
      structures on immune structures decreases. In DAT, the modulation of immune
      processes by limbicoreticular and thalamocortical structures, as well as the
      pontobulbar part of the brain stem increases. In middle age and in DAT, persons
      with different functional brain asymmetry (as estimated from electrophysiological
      criteria) have different lymphocytic functional activities and rates of
      neuroimmune interactions.

TI  - Antibodies against microglia/brain macrophages in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with acute amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and presenile dementia.
PG  - 197-200
AB  - This is the report of a case of a 41-year-old male patient with a rapidly
      progressing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) combined with a severe presenile 
      dementia. Screening for antibody binding on fresh-frozen human brain sections, we
      found that the patient's cerebrospinal fluid contained antibodies against
      microglia, the dominant and potentially cytotoxic immuneffector cell of the
      brain. This finding extends previous observations of CSF autoantibodies against
      microglia in neurodegenerative diseases. It demonstrates that in addition to
      antigens of neuronal origin (e.g. anti-Purkinje cell antibodies in paraneoplastic
      cerebellar dysfunction), glial antigens also appear to be under the surveillance 
      of the CNS and/or the peripheral immune system. Our data provide evidence for a
      close link between neurodegeneration and the activation of microglia; a possible 
      local antigen production against microglia/brain macrophages, which might
      regulate the concomitant glial activation in neurodegenerative diseases; and the 
      presence of microglia-binding cerebrospinal antibodies as a marker for the acuity
      of the disease process underlying the acute deterioration of the neurological and
      cognitive performance in patients with, e.g., ALS. Future therapeutic strategies 
      could therefore include the modulation of the possibly disease-promoting
      activation of microglia/brain macrophages.

TI  - Peripheral blood lymphocyte subset distribution and function in patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.
PG  - 212-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Until recently, new data on immune aspects of Alzheimer's disease
      (AD) have suggested that some facets of AD pathogenesis may be immune related.
      However, the effects of dementia itself on immune function have not been
      considered. AIM: To compare the distribution of peripheral blood lymphocyte
      subsets and their function in patients with AD and other dementias. METHODS:
      Peripheral blood lymphocyte numbers, T cell subset distribution, proliferative
      responses to mitogens and suppressor cell assay were studied in a well
      characterised group of patients with AD, and compared to patients with other
      forms of dementia. Age and sex matched elderly controls were screened to exclude 
      dementia, and young controls were medical, paramedical and laboratory staff.
      Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and student's test were used for statistical
      analysis. RESULTS: The CD8+ lymphocyte population was reduced in AD and in other 
      forms of dementia, when compared with non-demented elderly and young controls.
      Concanavalin A induced lymphocyte transformation was reduced in all dementia
      groups and in elderly compared with young controls. The changes in T cell numbers
      and function were not specific for Alzheimer's disease, but were found also in
      other forms of dementia.

TI  - Neurodegeneration in the limbic and paralimbic system in progressive supranuclear palsy.
PG  - 246-54
AB  - Progressive supranuclear palsy is neuropathologically characterized by neuronal
      degeneration of the basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum. In addition,
      cortical neuronal degeneration associated with neurofibrillary tangles formation 
      has been identified over wide areas of the brain in patients with progressive
      supranuclear palsy. We studied the distribution of alpha B-crystallin-positive
      degenerating neurons in cases with progressive supranuclear palsy, and compared
      them with those in Pick's disease. Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia of
      Alzheimer type, and normal aged individuals. A large number of alpha
      B-crystallin-positive neurons was found in the cerebral cortices of four out of
      nine patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. In particular, alpha
      B-crystallin-positive ballooned neurons were frequently observed in deep cortical
      pyramidal cell layers of the limbic and paralimbic systems in these diseases. The
      involvement of the limbic and paralimbic systems may thus contribute to
      personality changes as well as to memory and cognitive impairment in some
      patients with progressive supranuclear palsy.

TI  - Neurofibrillary degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam. Immunochemical characterization of tau proteins.
PG  - 924-32
AB  - Neurofibrillary tangles are observed in several neurodegenerative disorders
      including Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam. The major components of 
      neurofibrillary tangles are hyperphosphorylated tau proteins that can be directly
      detected in brain homogenates, using immunoblotting with specific immunological
      probes. To investigate whether tau proteins differ biochemically among various
      neurodegenerative disorders, we analyzed a series of brain samples from Guamanian
      patients in comparison with Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, 
      and normal aging. In Alzheimer's disease, these hyperphosphorylated tau proteins 
      are composed of a triplet referred to as tau 55, 64, and 69, whereas in
      progressive supranuclear palsy, neurofibrillary degeneration is characterized by 
      a tau doublet (tau 64 and 69). In the present study, characterization of tau
      proteins was performed by immunoblotting, on different cortical and subcortical
      regions of postmortem brain specimens from Guamanian natives. In all of the
      cases, biochemical data were always consistent with neuropathological findings.
      In contrast to Alzheimer's disease patients where the tau triplet is found mostly
      in cortical regions, a similar triplet was strongly detected in both cortical and
      subcortical areas in Guamanian patients. The tau profile differed quantitatively 
      from case to case demonstrating that the Alzheimer's disease-related tau triplet 
      had a heterogeneous regional distribution. These data suggest that the tau
      triplet found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex of
      Guam is similar to that observed in Alzheimer's disease, and the regional
      distribution of tau proteins differs in these disorders.

TI  - A clinical perspective on SPECT.
PG  - 38-47
AB  - The potential clinical utility of SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed
      Tomography) brain imaging to clarifying certain diagnostic dilemmas faced by
      clinical psychiatrists is considered generally and is illustrated by several case
      vignettes. Three case histories consider dementia vs depressive pseudodementia,
      two the possibility of a cerebral vasculitis in patients with auto-immune
      conditions, and two whether the patient had a "type" of depression likely to
      benefit from a course of ECT. Published studies reviewing the utility of SPECT in
      dementia, depression, depressive "pseudodementia" and cerebral lupus are
      considered. It is suggested that SPECT is an important investigatory technique
      providing additional information that may assist some diagnostic decisions, while
      its utility in assisting other clinical decisions awaits clarification.

TI  - Decreased density of forebrain cholinergic neurons and disintegration of the spatial organization of behavior in experimental autoimmune dementia (EAD).
PG  - 244-8
AB  - Experimental autoimmune dementia (EAD) is a rat model designed to examine the
      potential role of anti-cholinergic neurons antibodies (Abs) in the neuropathology
      of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. We have previously shown that sera of
      AD and Down's syndrome patients contain Abs which bind specifically to the high
      molecular weight neurofilament protein (NF-H) of the purely cholinergic
      electromotor neurons of Torpedo. Production of such Abs in EAD rats by prolonged 
      immunization with Torpedo cholinergic NF-H results in the accumulation of IgG in 
      the septum and hippocampus of the immunized rats and in memory deficits. In the
      present study, we examined immunohistochemically whether the anti-cholinergic
      NF-H immune response of the EAD rats affects their brain cholinergic neurons. In 
      addition, since dementia is associated with severe deterioration in the
      spatio-temporal organization of behavior, we examined whether EAD rats also mimic
      this important feature of dementia. The results obtained show that production in 
      EAD rats of anti-cholinergic NF-H Abs similar to those found in AD patients
      results in a marked decrease in the density of forebrain cholinergic neurons and 
      in derangements in the spatio-temporal organization of their behavior. These
      findings may replicate pathogenic processes in AD and support a role for
      anti-cholinergic NF-H Abs in the degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the
      disease.

TI  - Do endogenous retroviruses have etiological implications in inflammatory and degenerative nervous system diseases?
PG  - 190-8
AB  - Vertebrates carry large numbers of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and related
      sequences in their genomes. These retroviral elements are inherited as Mendelian 
      traits. Generally, ERVs are defective without the ability of being expressed as
      viral particles. However, ERV sequences often have a potential for expression of 
      at least some proteins. So far, the possible biological significance of ERVs is
      not clear. Nonetheless, there are observations suggesting a connection between
      ERVs and various diseases. This is the case with murine lupus and a spinal cord
      disease of certain mouse strains. In the present review, we discuss possible
      mechanisms by which ERVs could contribute to the development of human
      degenerative and inflammatory nervous system diseases, including direct effects
      on nervous system cells and immune cells. Interactions between ERVs and
      infectious viruses are also discussed. Finally, we review a possible retroviral
      etiology of multiple sclerosis.

TI  - Disintegration of the spatial organization of behavior in experimental autoimmune dementia.
PG  - 83-91
AB  - Experimental autoimmune dementia is a rat model designed to examine the potential
      role of anti-cholinergic neurons antibodies in neuronal degeneration in dementia 
      and Alzheimer's disease. We have previously shown that sera of patients with
      Alzheimer's disease contain antibodies which bind specifically to the high
      molecular weight neurofilament protein of the purely cholinergic electromotor
      neurons of Torpedo. Production of such antibodies in experimental autoimmune
      dementia rats by prolonged immunization with the Torpedo cholinergic high
      molecular weight neurofilament subunit results in accumulation of antibodies in
      the septum and hippocampus of the immunized rats, in a marked decrease in the
      density of forebrain cholinergic neurons, and in memory deficits. In the present 
      study we characterized the open-field behavior of experimental autoimmune
      dementia rats, and examined whether, like in dementia, the spatiotemporal
      organization of their behavior is impaired. The results obtained revealed that
      experimental autoimmune dementia rats travel shorter distances; explore a smaller
      part of the open-field; and perform less round-trips to the key location--the
      home base--in reference to which their behavior is normally organized. The
      shrinkage of the explored space and the reduced number of round trips are
      independent of the amount of locomotion and represent a deterioration in the
      organization of behavior in time and space. These behavioral changes are specific
      to the anti-cholinergic immune response of experimental autoimmune dementia rats 
      as they are not observed in rats which were immunized with chemically
      heterogeneous high molecular weight neurofilament subunit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

TI  - Decreased density of forebrain cholinergic neurons in experimental autoimmune dementia.
PG  - 75-82
AB  - Sera of Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome patients contain antibodies which
      bind specifically to the high molecular weight neurofilament protein of Torpedo
      cholinergic neurons. We have recently shown that prolonged immunization of rats
      with this antigen results in the accumulation of IgG in neurons in the septum and
      hippocampus of the immunized rats and in cognitive impairments. This animal model
      is termed experimental autoimmune dementia. In the present study we examined
      whether the anti-cholinergic high molecular weight neurofilament subunit immune
      response of the experimental autoimmune dementia rats affects forebrain
      cholinergic neurons. This was performed immunohistochemically utilizing a
      monoclonal antibody to nerve growth factor receptor, a specific marker of
      cholinergic neurons in the forebrain. The results obtained revealed significant
      decreases in the density of cholinergic neurons in the medial septal nucleus and 
      diagonal band of the experimental autoimmune dementia rats. These decreases are
      specific to the anti-cholinergic high molecular weight neurofilament subunit
      immune response of the experimental autoimmune dementia rats and are not observed
      in control rats which were immunized with chemically heterogeneous high molecular
      weight neurofilament subunit. The decrease in density of forebrain cholinergic
      neurons in experimental autoimmune dementia rats may mimic pathogenic processes
      in Alzheimer's disease and supports a role for anti-cholinergic high molecular
      weight neurofilament subunit antibodies in the degeneration of cholinergic
      neurons in the disease.

TI  - Animal models of age-related dementia: neurobehavioral dysfunctions in autoimmune mice.
PG  - 503-16
AB  - The development of strategies for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other
      age-associated dementias is an important goal of research in the neurosciences.
      It is suggested that advances in understanding of the etiology of those disorders
      would provide the most obvious avenues to development of preventative treatments.
      Research findings from both clinical investigations and studies of animal models 
      are presented which suggest a neuroimmunologic component in age-associated
      dementia. Clinical studies suggest an association between dementia and
      brain-reactive autoantibodies in subsets of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
      Studies of mice suggest that: 1) when compared with normal genotypes, mutant mice
      with accelerated autoimmunity show learning and memory impairments at earlier
      chronological ages; 2) the learning and memory deficits of autoimmune and normal 
      mice are qualitatively similar; 3) the behavioral deficits of normal aged and
      autoimmune mice are sensitive to similar pharmacologic interventions. Overall,
      these findings suggest that intervention strategies targeting the immune system
      might be useful in the treatment or prevention of aging-associated dementia.
      Autoimmune mice would be useful as models for the development and testing of such
      immune-based interventions.

TI  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leukoencephalopathy and the microcirculation.
PG  - 357-70
AB  - We studied the brains of three patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
      (AIDS), all of whom developed subacutely progressive dementia unassociated with
      opportunistic infection or neoplasm in the central nervous system. Computed
      tomographic (CT) scans of the head revealed cortical atrophy, ventricular
      dilation, and diffuse hypodensity of the centrum semiovale. On microscopic
      examination, the cerebral and cerebellar white matter in all cases showed diffuse
      and focal, angiocentric regions of myelin pallor, focal vacuolization, and
      extensive gliosis. Variable axonal loss and axonal spheroids were evident. The
      microvasculature showed striking changes, including mural thickening, increased
      cellularity, and enlargement and pleomorphism of endothelial cells with variable 
      numbers of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells (MNGC), which often
      contained hemosiderin pigment. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
      antigens were identified immunocytochemically within perivascular macrophages and
      MNGC and in some microglial cells. We suggest that the morphologic abnormalities 
      of the microcirculation may be associated with an alteration of the blood-brain
      barrier. The increased vascular permeability could contribute to damage and loss 
      of the white matter including both myelin and axons, and result in subcortical
      cerebral atrophy. The HIV-1 infected cells present in relation to the
      microvasculature may play a role in mediating the vascular injury.

AB  - We investigated serum neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine concentrations in 23 
      HIV-1 seropositive patients (Walter Reed Stage 4-6). Ten patients presented with 
      polyneuropathy and three with dementia, one of the patients with dementia also
      had polyneuropathy and dementia. We found significant associations between lower 
      trytophan concentrations and neurologic/psychiatric symptoms. The negative
      correlation of tryptophan with kynurenine and neopterin concentrations indicates 
      activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in patients. IDO can be induced by 
      cytokines such as interferon-gamma and therefore low tryptophan levels may result
      from chronic immune stimulation in HIV-1 seropositives.

PG  - 109-16
AB  - Cytokines play an important role not only for initiation of immune reactivity but
      also for development of tissue injury. Of 38 patients infected with human
      immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) were identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 22 (58%) and
      16 (42%) patients, respectively. Among the IL-1 beta- and IL-6-positive CSF were 
      eight of 15 HIV-1 patients with no clinical signs of central nervous system
      involvement and four of five patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
      (AIDS) dementia complex. The presence of IL-6 was often associated with IL-1 beta
      and soluble interleukin-2 receptor in CSF as well as with intrathecal IgG
      synthesis. In none of the CSF samples tumor necrosis factor-alpha or
      interleukin-2 was detected.

      infections, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome dementia complex (ADC). There
      was a high correlation between the CSF beta 2M concentration and ADC severity,
      suggesting that CSF beta 2M may be useful as a marker for the development,
      progression, and perhaps response to treatment of ADC. Elevated CSF beta 2M was
      not due to CSF pleocytosis and was usually independent of blood-brain barrier
      dysfunction.

TI  - Slow virus diseases of the central nervous system.
PG  - 130-2
AB  - Slow virus diseases are characterized by a long asymptomatic period, often months
      or years in duration, between the introduction of the infectious agent and the
      appearance of clinical illness. Two distinct groups cause serious degenerative
      diseases of the brain and spinal cord. The first to be identified are those
      caused by "unconventional agents," kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The second
      category, "conventional virus diseases," include SSPE (subacute sclerosing
      panencephalitis), PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), progressive
      rubella encephalitis, and HIV encephalopathy. The universal focus on acquired
      immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has stimulated new research on slow viruses.
      The extreme neurological deficits, the chronic nature of these diseases, and the 
      possible concern with infection control make patients with these diseases a
      challenge to nursing.

TI  - Neopterin concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid and serum of individuals infected with HIV-1.
PG  - 285-8
AB  - Neopterin, a biochemical marker for the activation of cell-mediated immune
      reactions, was determined in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients
      infected with HIV-1. A significant correlation was found between serum and CSF
      neopterin concentrations, although concentrations of neopterin in serum were more
      closely correlated with the clinical severity of HIV-1 infection than those in
      CSF. However, higher CSF levels were observed in patients with
      neurologic/psychiatric symptoms than in unaffected patients. Also, quotients of
      CSF neopterin versus serum neopterin concentrations were increased, indicating
      intrathecal production of neopterin. Positive HIV-1 isolation from peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was associated with higher neopterin
      concentrations in serum, when compared with negative HIV-1 isolation. Neopterin
      in CSF appears to be a suitable biochemical marker in patients with HIV-1
      infection for detecting overt neurologic/psychiatric disturbances. The data
      suggest that in HIV-1 infected patients, cell-mediated immune reactions might be 
      activated intrathecally and might contribute to neuropsychiatric disease.

TI  - Elevated neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid occur early in HIV-1 infection.
PG  - 277-83
AB  - Neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-M) concentrations in cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) and blood were measured in 56 individuals in various stages of HIV-1 
      infection. Elevated levels of neopterin as well as beta 2-M were found in the CSF
      of three patients with primary HIV-1 infection and also in subjects in the early 
      stages of chronic HIV-1 infection, with the highest levels in HIV-1
      isolation-positive people. There was a clear correlation between the
      concentrations of the two substances and the levels seemed to increase in
      parallel with progress of infection. A similar pattern was found in blood. Higher
      concentrations of neopterin and beta 2-M in CSF than in blood were found in
      patients with advanced dementia in particular. These findings indicate that the
      cellular immune system in the central nervous system (CNS) may be activated
      during the early stages of HIV-1 infection without concomitant overt neurological
      symptoms. The pathological processes in CNS and blood seem to develop in parallel
      rather than being restricted to one compartment.

TI  - Spongiform encephalopathy in AIDS dementia complex: report of five cases.
PG  - 374-81
AB  - We describe the morphological findings in the brain of five AIDS patients who
      died with a clinical diagnosis of dementia. We have found a spongiform change
      (small rounded vacuoles) in different parts of the brain and a similar but
      morphologically different sponginess, the status spongiosus, characterized by
      looser and coarser microcystic cavitations of the grey matter in which the tiny
      cysts and vacuoles are enmeshed by glial fibrils. At the ultrastructural level,
      round and oval clear spaces, divided by septae into several smaller ones,
      appeared in the neuropil. The pathogenesis of the majority of the vacuoles and
      cavitations is not clear yet but a focal loss of cortical neurons was evident and
      furthermore some of the vacuoles were identified as remnants of dendrites. The
      light and electron microscopic findings can not be interpreted as artefacts or as
      a simple edema of the brain and also can not be explained by the different
      infective complications. We have found spongiform alterations in all cases of
      clinically diagnosed dementia and therefore it seems obvious that these findings 
      are quite frequent in AIDS dementia.

TI  - [Psychopathologic pictures in HIV infection: AIDS lethargy and AIDS dementia].
PG  - 173-85
AB  - The paper describes the psychiatric status on the basis of 76 patients with
      acquired immune deficiency syndrome. There is considerable difference between the
      different stages of the disease. The disorders are divided into groups following 
      the German and French psychopathological tradition, where the incidence is
      dependent on the underlying complaint. 50% of the patients suffered from chronic 
      psychoorganic disorders (34% organic personality disorders, 16% dementia). 9%
      suffered from an acute psychosis caused by complications and founded on
      substantial physical illness. 3 patients showed symptoms of a (under given
      circumstances) hitherto unknown endoform psychosis. In 9% of the patients,
      psychoreactive disturbances (anxiety and reactive depression) were observed. Two 
      infants had congenital development deficiencies. 25% of the patients were without
      any psychopathology. Patients showing organic personality disorders mostly
      resemble each other to such a degree as to form a separate group. We suggest to
      name this group according to the most prominent psychopathology as
      "AIDS-lethargy". This status is characterised by a specific apathy, tiredness and
      indolence of the patients combined with the lack of emotional participation
      related to their own destiny. AIDS-lethargy is the first manifestation in
      appearance of the HIV infection of the brain itself. Another sequel of the brain 
      infection is AIDS dementia which can be classified as "subcortical dementia" and 
      differs from the more current forms of dementia clinically. Affected are mainly
      neuropsychologic functions like arousal, attention, mood and motivation, whereas 
      the hallmarks of cortical involvement-aphasia, agnosia and apraxia-are not
      present. Supplementary findings (EEG, CCT, CSF): The group of patients with
      chronic psychoorganic disorders differs significantly from the group with
      psychoreactive disorders and normals. Pathological EEG and CCT are more frequent 
      in psychoorganic disorders. CSF-test-including the intrathecally synthesized
      antibodies against HIV-does not show traceable variation in either group. There
      are four problems which may be combined in a given acute psychopathological
      HIV-syndrome: 1. Being member of a risk group with its reactive, psychosocial and
      personality problems. 2. Individual mental and emotional reaction to the fact of 
      infection 3. Chronic psychoorganic disturbances. 4. Acute organic psychoses as a 
      result of complications and other physical illness.

PG  - 397-401
AB  - We examined serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 16 patients with Alzheimer's
      disease (AD), 28 patients with vascular dementia (VD), their age-matched controls
      and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in order to evaluate the humoral immune
      response within the central nervous system both quantitatively and qualitatively.
      Intra-blood-brain barrier (BBB) protein synthesis was calculated by CSF IgG
      index. The presence of oligoclonal banding (OCB) was investigated with agarose
      isoelectric focusing (IEF) followed by immunoblotting with antihuman IgG. No
      patient with AD and only 4 patients with VD had slightly elevated IgG indexes,
      and no statistically significant differences in the indexes were found between
      the two groups. No bands were found in the CSF of AD patients but 3 VD patients
      had OCB in both serum and CSF. One VD patient had bands in serum but no bands in 
      CSF. No kappa or lambda free light chains were found in those demented patients
      with demonstrable bands in the CSF and serum. No OCB were found in control sera
      and CSF. For comparison, the majority of patients with MS had OCB in CSF. Thus,
      no consistent increase of intrathecal protein synthesis was found in patients
      with AD and VD. Methodological differences explain at least part of the
      conflicting results published earlier.

TI  - Antiserum to scrapie-associated fibril protein reacts with amyloid plaques in familial transmissible dementia.
PG  - 158-65
AB  - Scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF) are disease-specific markers for the
      unconventional agent-induced, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
      Polyclonal rabbit antiserum to SAF protein was reacted with brain sections from
      scrapie-infected mice, two familial cases of transmissible dementia, and three
      cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specific immunostaining of cerebral amyloid
      plaques occurred in the scrapie-infected mice and in the two familial cases of
      transmissible dementia. No immunoreactivity was detected in senile plaques or
      neurofibrillary tangles in the three cases of AD. Our results suggest that SAF,
      the causative pathogenic agent, and extracellular deposits of amyloid in the
      brain are closely related. Immunohistochemical detection of SAF protein could
      serve as a useful diagnostic adjunct in the postmortem evaluation of difficult
      cases of dementia. The identification of SAF protein in the brains of two
      affected members of a family combining the clinical and pathological features of 
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and the Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome (GSS)
      substantiates earlier conclusions of a nosological relationship between the two. 
      Our study provides further evidence of the similarity of SAF protein to prion
      protein (PrP 27-30).

TI  - AIDS and its dementia as a neuropeptide disorder: role of VIP receptor blockade by human immunodeficiency virus envelope.
PG  - S71-3
AB  - The CD4 molecule was originally described as a marker for a subset of
      lymphocytes; however, recent work has shown that a similar, if not identical,
      molecule is present on human brain. We have realized that this cell-surface
      recognition molecule is normally modulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide
      (VIP), one of the 50 or more neuropeptides that compose a shared intercellular
      network joining the brain, glands, and immune system. Human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV), the etiological agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), 
      has been found to mimic VIP binding via peptide T (4-8), a pentapeptide sequence 
      present in approximately the same region of all 20 HIV isolates whose sequences
      are currently known. AIDS dementia results from interference of gp120, present on
      the HIV envelope protein, with normal VIP-ergic neurotrophic effects, and effects
      on cerebral blood flow.

TI  - AIDS and dementia: a quantitative neuropsychological study of unselected Danish patients.
PG  - 443-7
AB  - Retrospective studies of hospitalized patients with the acquired immune
      deficiency syndrome (AIDS) have indicated that dementia occur in the majority of 
      cases. In order to study the occurrence of dementia among AIDS patients, we
      conducted a controlled study of 16 unselected cases with a battery of
      neuropsychological tests known to be sensitive to brain damage of various
      etiologies. Except for fatigue, mental complaints and neuropsychiatric signs of
      dementia were generally sparse. As a group, the AIDS patients' performance in the
      neuropsychological tests did not differ from that of matched, healthy controls.
      Based on analyses of individual test results only one patient performed
      significantly inferior to what should be expected. The diagnosis of dementia
      should not be ascribed to AIDS victims on account of non-specific
      psycho-behavioral deviations that may represent a normal psychologic reaction to 
      the disease, extreme fatigue, or both. Further, frequency measures of dementia in
      AIDS, based on large, unselected groups and with sufficient control, are still
      lacking. However, our study indicates that dementia is a less frequent
      complication of AIDS than so far assumed.

TI  - AIDS: an overview for the neuroscience nurse.
PG  - 296-9
AB  - Four out of ten acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients develop
      neurologic complications. Because of the complex nervous system dysfunction
      experienced by these patients, neuroscience nurses face an extraordinary
      challenge. To provide care for patients with neurological complications of AIDS, 
      the neuroscience nurse must understand the nature of the disease and its effects 
      on the central nervous system. With this broad knowledge base, effective nursing 
      interventions can be implemented.

TI  - Tau antisera recognize neurofibrillary tangles in a range of neurodegenerative disorders.
PG  - 514-20
AB  - Neurofibrillary tangles occur in a number of apparently distinct
      neurodegenerative diseases and in normal aging of the human brain. Antibodies
      raised against Alzheimer's disease paired helical filaments immunolabel the
      tangles seen in all other tangle-associated disorders examined to date. The
      neuronal microtubule-associated protein, tau, has recently been identified as an 
      antigenic component of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaque neurites in
      Alzheimer's disease. Three different polyclonal antibodies with strong tau
      immunoreactivity are examined in this study. These antibodies were found to
      immunostain tangles in normal aged brain and in brains affected by a range of
      neurodegenerative disorders, including Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease plus 
      Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and the
      parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam, as well as Pick bodies in Pick's disease. 
      The findings further illustrate the relative nonspecificity of neurofibrillary
      lesions in neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Formic acid pretreatment enhances immunostaining of cerebral and systemic amyloids.
PG  - 230-6
AB  - The purpose of this study was to design a method by which immunoperoxidase
      staining can be applied to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections to
      demonstrate amyloid deposits in cerebral and systemic amyloidotic tissues. We
      used anti-prion protein, anti-beta-protein, anti-amyloid A, and anti-prealbumin
      antisera. The tissue sections were first treated with 100% formic acid for 5, 20,
      or 60 minutes and the unlabeled immunoperoxidase method (biotin-streptavidin
      system reagents) was used. This formic acid pretreatment enhanced
      immunoreactivity of the amyloid deposits which reacted positively with specific
      antiserum. The specificity of the immunostainings was well preserved. This method
      can also be used to demonstrate interspecies cross-reactivity, by using
      anti-human amyloid A and anti-scrapie hamster prion protein antisera, which
      stained negatively or faintly with amyloid deposits of heterogenous species. The 
      technique is expected to reveal the buried epitopes of amyloid deposits in tissue
      sections.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus infection was identified immunohistochemically in
      the brains of 8 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome dementia
      complex. Using a monoclonal antibody against a structural viral protein (p25),
      infection was detected in white matter and basal ganglia in a distribution
      paralleling that of the major neuropathological abnormalities. Viral antigen was 
      identified principally in perivascular and parenchymal macrophages and in
      multinucleated cells of macrophage origin that were identified morphologically
      and by immunocytochemical staining for acid phosphatase isozyme. In 4 of the 8
      patients, viral antigen was also detected in acid-phosphatase-negative,
      process-bearing neuroglial cells; in 2 patients, antigen was detected in basal
      ganglion cells that were morphologically consistent with neurons and in
      alkaline-phosphatase-positive cells with elongated nuclei that were most likely
      of endothelial origin.

      patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex.
      Subacute encephalitis was mainly distributed in the frontal (58%) and temporal
      (69%) lobes, basal ganglia (77%), amygdala (80%), and hippocampus (64%). Ten
      (37%) with moderate or severe subacute encephalitis were demented; 82% with mild 
      subacute encephalitis had no recognized neurologic disorder. Human T-lymphotropic
      virus type III (HTLV-III) was isolated from neural tissue or CSF in 11 of 13
      patients, 10 with subacute encephalitis, and 1 without CNS lesions. We conclude
      that subacute encephalitis is common in AIDS patients and is most likely caused
      by CNS infection with HTLV-III.

TI  - [Neuropathologic principles of senile dementia].
PG  - 181-4
AB  - Several groups of senile dementias with differing causes and neurohistological
      substrates can be distinguished. Genetically determined Pick's disease produces
      severe neuronal atrophy; Alzheimer's disease is characterized by pathological
      neurofibrillary changes. Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease and
      Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease are slow virus diseases induced by
      unconventional agents. These diseases, after an incubation time of several years,
      take the course of slowly progressive degenerative diseases of the central
      nervous system without inflammatory and specific immune reactions of the host
      organism. Regarding pathogenesis these diseases were interpreted as degenerative 
      processes as long as their transmissibility was yet unknown. The fact that
      so-called slow virus diseases can also produce argyrophilic plaques is a further 
      common feature of this group of diseases and human pathological aging processes. 
      So far, however, there is no proof that Alzheimer's disease is caused by an
      unconventional agent. On the other hand, common features of the products of aging
      changes and of unconventional viral diseases are apparent. In this paper current 
      knowledge of pathogenetic mechanisms in this rapidly developing field of research
      is presented. Some relevant factors of organic dementia are discussed: special
      characteristics of neuronal atrophy (functional role of dendrites);
      architectonics of cerebral atrophy (laminar versus modular atrophy);
      neurotransmitter changes (causes or sequels of dementia) and a possibly
      non-specific origin of senile plaques. Finally, the clinical relevance of
      neurobiological research into dementias is emphasized.

PG  - 2160-5
AB  - A procedure for improving the specificity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
      (ELISA) was devised, based on addition of antigen-specific or non-immune
      immunoglobulins to the citrated plasma sample and defining the difference in
      assay response between these two mixtures as the antigen-specific part of the
      response. When applied to measurement of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA; EC
      3.4.21.31) antigen in plasma, this procedure resulted in elimination of the
      overestimates obtained in a large proportion (10-20%) of patients' samples when
      assayed according to the conventional ELISA technique. Basal t-PA concentrations 
      in plasma were found to be highly age-dependent, normal values being about 3
      micrograms/L for adults near 30 years of age and about 10 micrograms/L for those 
      over 60. Patients with gallbladder stone disease had increased mass
      concentrations of t-PA in plasma, even when corrected for the age effect;
      patients with multi-infarct dementia did not.

TI  - Detection of AIDS virus in macrophages in brain tissue from AIDS patients with encephalopathy.
PG  - 1089-93
AB  - One of the common neurological complications in patients with the acquired immune
      deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a subacute encephalopathy with progressive
      dementia. By using the techniques of cocultivation for virus isolation, in situ
      hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy, the
      identity of an important cell type that supports replication of the AIDS
      retrovirus in brain tissue was determined in two affected individuals. These
      cells were mononucleated and multinucleated macrophages that actively synthesized
      viral RNA and produced progeny virions in the brains of the patients. Infected
      brain macrophages may serve as a reservoir for virus and as a vehicle for viral
      dissemination in the infected host.

TI  - The AIDS dementia complex: I. Clinical features.
PG  - 517-24
AB  - Of 70 autopsied patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), 46 
      suffered progressive dementia that was frequently accompanied by motor and
      behavioral dysfunction. Impaired memory and concentration with psychomotor
      slowing represented the most common early presentation of this disorder, but in
      nearly one half of the patients either motor or behavioral changes predominated. 
      Early motor deficits commonly included ataxia, leg weakness, tremor, and loss of 
      fine-motor coordination, while behavioral disturbances were manifested most
      commonly as apathy or withdrawal, but occasionally as a frank organic psychosis. 
      The course of the disease was steadily progressive in most patients, and at times
      was punctuated by an abrupt acceleration. However, in 20% of patients a more
      protracted indolent course was observed. In the most advanced stage of this
      disease, patients exhibited a stereotyped picture of severe dementia, mutism,
      incontinence, paraplegia, and in some cases, myoclonus. The high incidence and
      unique clinical presentation of this AIDS dementia complex is consistent with the
      emerging concept that this complication is due to direct brain infection by the
      retrovirus that causes AIDS.

TI  - The AIDS dementia complex: II. Neuropathology.
PG  - 525-35
AB  - In order to define the histopathological substrate of the dementia that
      frequently complicates the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), we
      analyzed the neuropathological findings in 70 autopsied adult AIDS patients, 46
      of whom had suffered clinically overt dementia. Less than 10% of the brains were 
      histologically normal. Abnormalities were found predominantly in the white matter
      and in subcortical structures, with relative sparing of the cortex. Their
      frequency and severity generally correlated well with the degree and duration of 
      clinical dementia. Most commonly noted was diffuse pallor in the white matter,
      which in the pathologically milder cases was accompanied by scanty perivascular
      infiltrates of lymphocytes and brown-pigmented macrophages, and in the most
      advanced cases by clusters of foamy macrophages and multinucleated cells
      associated with multifocal rarefaction of the white matter. However, in nearly
      one third of the demented cases the histopathological findings were remarkably
      bland in relation to the severity of clinical dysfunction. In addition, similar
      mild changes were noted in over one half of the nondemented patients, consistent 
      with subclinical involvement. Vacuolar myelopathy was found in 23 patients and
      was generally more common and severe in patients with advanced brain pathology.
      Evidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was noted in nearly one quarter of
      the brains and was associated with a relative abundance of microglial nodules,
      but correlated neither with the major subcortical neuropathology nor with the
      clinical dementia, indicating that CMV infection likely represented a second,
      superimposed process. This study establishes the AIDS dementia complex as a
      distinct clinical and pathological entity and, together with accumulating
      virological evidence, suggests that it is caused by direct LAV/HTLV-III brain
      infection.

AB  - The authors report a case of encephalitis occurring in a setting consistent with 
      acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). They point out that AIDS and its
      complications can mimic psychiatric syndromes, including depression and dementia,
      or delirium related to illnesses such as alcoholism. Acting out behavior, seen in
      the present case, may also be mistaken as a symptom of sociopathy.

TI  - Immune complexes in CSF and serum in various neurological diseases.
PG  - 249-52
AB  - A technique whereby immune complexes (ICs) are detected in the CSF and serum from
      their inhibitory effect on the agglutination of IgG-coated latex particles by
      rheumatoid factor (RF) has been applied to patients with the following
      neurological diseases: multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory diseases, extradural
      peripheral neuropathies (EPN), CNS tumors, dementia, and a control group of other
      neurological diseases (OND). The groups did not differ significantly in respect
      of IC positivity either in CSF or serum. The MS group was tested for correlations
      between percentage of IC positives and CSF IgG/Albumin ratio on the one hand and 
      presence of oligoclonal bands on isoelectric focusing on the other. The
      specificity of ICs to the dysimmune condition is discussed.

TI  - Is aging inevitable? The intracellular zinc deficiency hypothesis of aging.
PG  - 117-37
AB  - A review of the literature suggests that an intracellular zinc deficiency may be 
      the primary cause of the aging process. Zinc-metalloenzymes play an important
      role in many aspects of cellular metabolism including DNA replication, repair and
      transcription. The main enzymes affected by zinc deficiency may be specific for
      each cell type. Depending on which zinc enzymes are "overvulnerable", zinc
      deficiency may result in accumulation of useless (or toxic) materials,
      malproduction of essential proteins, a neoplastic change or cell death, thus
      explaining the variability in aging patterns in different cell types. There is no
      simple and reliable index of zinc status in humans and a therapeutic trial may be
      needed to establish zinc deficiency. Finding a zinc-compound which can enter the 
      cell and avoid the development of intracellular zinc deficiency may retard the
      aging process and postpone age-related diseases.

TI  - Neural tissue hypersensitivity in psychiatric disorders with immunologic features.
PG  - 853s-857s
AB  - The study population consisted of 1010 in patients and 81 control subjects.
      Patients suffering from schizophrenia, cerebral atrophy of unknown origin,
      dementia, depression, mental retardation, and ethanol-induced brain deterioration
      (alcoholics) were skin tested with 25 micrograms of S-100 protein and
      neuron-specific enolase isolated from fresh human brain. Evaluation of delayed
      skin hypersensitivity reactions at 24 hr revealed a high incidence of positive
      responses to S-100 protein: heavy alcoholism, 96.8%; depression, 94.1%; cerebral 
      atrophy, 92.6%; dementia, 91.2%; schizophrenia, 87.7%; and mental retardation,
      69.4%. The incidence of positive reactions to neuron-specific enolase in
      schizophrenics was 91.6%. Of 58 control subjects tested with S-100 protein, 6.8% 
      were positive, whereas of 23 normal individuals tested with neuron-specific
      enolase, 6.4% developed mild skin reactions. These data suggest a close
      relationship between delayed hypersensitivity to neural tissue antigens and
      immunopsychiatric diseases, and they imply that cell-mediated immune mechanisms
      are involved in the pathogenesis of certain mental disorders.

TI  - A survey of serum antibodies to eight common viruses in psychiatric patients.
PG  - 137-44
AB  - Serum antibody titres to eight neurotropic viruses were measured by enzyme
      immunoassay in 450 psychiatric in-patients and 143 controls. A seasonal variation
      in schizophrenic births was observed, with a peak incidence between March and
      April. Both herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus antibody titres correlated
      with age and, when this was controlled for, no significant differences emerged
      between any patient group and the controls. Mumps antibody titres were
      significantly lower in patients with mental subnormal and neurosis or personality
      disorder; measles and rubella antibody titres were lower in male but not female
      mentally handicapped patients; males had lower antibody titres to mumps,
      cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus than females in all groups. A decrease in 
      mumps antibody titres was also found in schizophrenics if the medication factor
      was excluded. These low antibody titres may indicate an impaired immune response.
      Thus perinatal or childhood subclinical viral infections of the central nervous
      system, particularly of mumps, might lead to a range of possible psychiatric
      outcomes in later life.

TI  - HTLV-III infection in brains of children and adults with AIDS encephalopathy.
PG  - 177-82
AB  - Unexplained debilitating dementia or encephalopathy occurs frequently in adults
      and children with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Brains from 15 
      individuals with AIDS and encephalopathy were examined by Southern analysis and
      in situ hybridization for the presence of human T-cell leukemia (lymphotropic)
      virus type III (HTLV-III), the virus believed to be the causative agent of AIDS. 
      HTLV-III DNA was detected in the brains of five patients, and viral-specific RNA 
      was detected in four of these. In view of these findings and the recent
      demonstration of morphologic and genetic relatedness between HTLV-III and visna
      virus, a lentivirus that causes a chronic degenerative neurologic disease in
      sheep, HTLV-III should be evaluated further as a possible cause of AIDS
      encephalopathy.

TI  - An immunologic assessment of brain-associated IgG in senile cerebral amyloidosis.
PG  - 481-8
AB  - Frontal and occipital lobes were taken within four hours of death from four
      senile patients (77-94 years) and frozen at -70 degrees C. After thawing at room 
      temperature, gray and white matter were separated and subjected to sequential
      elution at pH 7.4 and pH 2.5. The eluates were processed for isoelectric focusing
      on 2.5% polyacrylamide gels and stained with silver nitrate; immunoblotting was
      done on agarose gels and stained by immunoperoxidase for IgG and light chains.
      Quantitation of the amount of IgG present in neutral and acidic eluates was
      performed by immunonephelometry and ELISA. Only the neutral eluates contained
      significant amounts of IgG, which were usually polyclonal. These data indicate
      that IgG associated with senile cerebral amyloid are not bound to any brain or
      vascular component and the data do not support the occurrence of an
      intraparenchymal immune response.

TI  - Alzheimer disease: evidence for susceptibility loci on chromosomes 6 and 14.
PG  - 443-53
AB  - We report the transmission of HLA haplotypes and Gm allotypes in 97 members of a 
      single kindred containing 257 individuals, 45 of whom were determined by clinical
      examination, autopsy, or historical data to have had Alzheimer disease (AD).
      Extensive inbreeding suggests that more than one gene may contribute to
      susceptibility to AD in this family, despite the apparent vertical transmission
      of illness. The distribution of HLA haplotypes and of Gm allotypes to affected
      and unaffected siblings is consistent with the possibility that genes in the HLA 
      region of chromosome 6 and perhaps also in the Gm region of chromosome 14 are
      determinants of susceptibility. Further studies are needed to investigate whether
      susceptibility to AD may result from an interaction between (immune response?)
      genes on these two chromosomes.

AB  - Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is a newly described, highly virulent,
      idiopathic syndrome characterized by lymphocyte dysfunction, multiple
      opportunistic infections and lymphoma, which primarily affects previously
      healthy, promiscuous homosexual males. Dementia and delirium due to infection
      and/or disseminated lymphoma may frequently occur in these patients, especially
      as the illness progresses. Consulting and liaison psychiatrists must be
      particularly alert to the possibility of organicity in these patients, in
      addition to the psychological distress caused by the AIDS syndrome itself.

TI  - The viral hypothesis in parkinsonism.
PG  - 75-88
AB  - The most crucial unanswered question in Parkinson's disease is its fundamental
      cause. Since Carlsson's original suggestion that dopamine may be a transmitter in
      the central nervous system involved in the control of motor function and that it 
      may be involved in the Parkinsonian syndrome (Carlsson, 1959), and the
      now-classic paper by Ehringer and Hornykiewicz (1960) which definitively showed
      the significant reduction of dopamine concentration in the neostriatum of cases
      of idiopathic Parkinson and postencephalitic parkinsonism, the vast amount of
      work on the subject has focused on the biochemical and pharmacologic correlates
      of this dopaminergic system failure involving particularly the nigrostriatal
      pathways. The concept of a specific neurotransmitter deficiency associated with a
      specific neurological syndrome potentially amenable to replacement therapy, has
      appropriately generated a considerable degree of clinical and research interest
      for over 20 years, but, with few exceptions, there has been hardly any focused or
      concerted research effort on looking at direct causal factors or primary
      initiating events in this disease process. As in Alzheimer's disease, another of 
      the degenerative diseases of the brain of unknown origin with a specific
      biochemical substrate, any etiologic hypothesis for Parkinson's disease--whether 
      a virus, an age-related immune system dysfunction, a genetic factor, a "trophic" 
      substance, or a toxin--would have to explain the selective involvement of
      specific transmitter-defined neuronal pathways, the non-specificity of the brain 
      lesions that define the disease, and the clinical involvement of a sizeable
      segment of the aging population. Of the several plausible hypotheses mentioned
      earlier, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive, we would like to
      critically consider the possibility of a viral cause.

AB  - To confirm and extend previous observations concerning the correlation between
      cell-mediated immunity and psychiatric diseases, 511 patients with schizophrenia,
      cerebral atrophy, dementia, and mental retardation, and 32 control subjects and
      27 control patients were skin-tested with human brain S-100 protein and human
      liver protein: 70.2-93.1% of tested psychiatric patients developed positive skin 
      hypersensitivity reactions to S-100 protein, while 2.8-20.7% of patients reacted 
      to liver protein. Of control subjects, 6.2-7.4% responded to S-100 protein, and
      7.4-9.4% to liver protein. The findings indicate that cell-mediated immune
      processes may be involved in brain mechanisms underlying cerebral atrophy,
      depression, dementia, schizophrenia, and mental retardation.

TI  - Senile cerebral amyloid. Prealbumin as a common constituent in the neuritic plaque, in the neurofibrillary tangle, and in the microangiopathic lesion.
PG  - 41-50
AB  - Three lesions that characterize the nosologic findings in the brain of
      Alzheimer's presenile dementia and senile dementia of Alzheimer type, ie,
      neuritic plaque, neurofibrillary tangle, and microangiopathy, all are frequently 
      associated with amyloid deposition. There has been some question, however, as to 
      whether these lesions share the same etiology. Moreover, the specific chemical
      nature of amyloid associated with these lesions has not yet been determined. In
      the present study, formalin-fixed paraffin sections of the affected brains were
      tested immunocytochemically for their reactivity against antiserum to prealbumin 
      (recently disclosed as the major constituent of amyloid associated with familial 
      amyloidotic polyneuropathy as well as senile cardiac amyloid) and known
      components of other types of amyloid (AA, AP, etc.). The results demonstrated
      that amyloid deposits in all three lesions reacted with anti-prealbumin,
      suggesting that it is a common constituent of these lesions. Indeed, it is likely
      that prealbumin is the major constituent of amyloid associated with neuritic
      plaque, neurofibrillary tangle, and microangiopathy.

TI  - Nutritional implications of the free-radical theory of aging.
PG  - 27-34
AB  - Aging is the progressive accumulation of changes with time associated with and/or
      responsible for the ever-increasing susceptibility to disease and death. These
      time-related changes are attributed to the aging process. This process may be due
      in part to free radical reactions, largely those involving oxygen, going on
      continuously throughout the cells and tissues. Dietary manipulations expected to 
      lower the rate of production of free-radical reaction damage have been shown to
      1) increase the life span of mice, rats, fruit flies, nematodes, and rotifers, as
      well as the life span of neurospora, 2) inhibit development of some forms of
      cancer, 3) enhance humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, and 4) slow
      development of amyloidosis and the autoimmune disorders of NZB mice. Free-radical
      reactions may also play a significant role in the deterioration of the
      cardiovascular and central nervous systems with age. It is reasonable to expect, 
      on the basis of present data, that the healthy life span can be increased by five
      or more years by keeping body weight down, at a level compatible with a sense of 
      well-being, while ingesting diets adequate in essential nutrients but designed to
      minimize random free-radical reactions in the body.

TI  - Down's syndrome, aging, and Alzheimer's disease: a clinical review.
PG  - 15-27
AB  - This review has been directed towards those aspects of DS which bear upon
      pathological aging. Clinical dementia in DS has heretofore been studied largely
      by retrospective methods with variable findings. A prospective study utilizing
      techniques designed to measure cognitive performance in a poorly verbal, retarded
      population is badly needed. There is definitive evidence for Alzheimer's disease 
      changes in the brains of DS patients with some suggestion of altered topography
      compared to the general population. Immunological studies have established a
      T-cell deficiency in DS that may be linked to precocious aging of
      thymic-dependent processes. Both antiviral and nonantiviral effects of interferon
      are accentuated in cell culture systems utilizing DS tissue, presumably as a
      consequence of the localization of the interferon gene(s) on chromosome 21.
      Multiple endocrine studies confirm the high frequency of autoimmune disease, an
      abnormality that may be related to the problems of immune surveillance in DS.
      Precocious aging has been noted in regards to measures of skin elasticity,
      fenestration of cardiac valves, and premature cataracts. The 21st chromosome has 
      been implicated in the elevated activity of superoxide dismutase, a finding of
      significance in regard to potential intracellular damage from increased levels of
      peroxide. Several studies have suggested a compensatory increase in glutathione
      peroxidase.

TI  - Humoral immunity in Guamanians with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism-dementia.
PG  - 193-6
AB  - Among Guamanian natives, serum IgA and IgG levels were found to be higher than
      normal in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); serum IgA was higher and IgM lower
      than normal in parkinsonism-dementia (PD). IgA levels increased with age in ALS, 
      PD, and normal subjects; IgG increased with age in ALS and IgM decreased with age
      in PD. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels did not correlate with the duration of
      either disease. Immunodeficient ALS and PD patients had higher IgM and lower IgA 
      levels than the other ALS and PD patients. Neither differences in viral antibody 
      titers nor the presence of autoantibodies or circulating immune complexes could
      account for the variations in serum Ig levels between patients and controls. We
      conclude that differences in serum Ig levels in ALS and PD patients are probably 
      due to repeated infections and abnormal immunoregulation accompanying
      immunodeficiency during the course of ALS and PD, rather than to a specific
      antiviral or autoimmune response.

TI  - Immunocytochemical studies of neurofibrillary tangles.
PG  - 77-89
AB  - The molecular nature of neurofibrillary tangles of senile dementia of the
      Alzheimer type (SDAT) was studied by immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence
      techniques. Five antiserums, including
      anti-humanbrain-2-cycle-purified-microtubule-fractions (2 x MT),
      anti-calf-brain-2 x MT, anti-sea-urchin-egg-tubulin, antibeef-brain-tubulin, and 
      anti-human-brain-neurofilament(NF)-210-kilodalton(kd)-protein were tested for
      their binding to neurofibrillary tangles. The antihuman-2 x MT serum stained
      structures resembling neurofibrillary tangles, neurites of neuritic plaques, and 
      microglialike cells in SDAT brains, but no such staining pattern was detected in 
      normal brain sections. In neurons isolated from SDAT brains, about 40% of the
      tangles were labeled by the anti-human-2xMT serum with an identical pattern.
      Other antiserums tested did not preferentially bind tanglelike structures in
      tissue sections and bound to less than 5% of the tangles in isolated neurons.
      These results suggest that the antigenic sites of tubulin and NF proteins are not
      shared by neurofibrillary tangles. Different from the calf preparation, the
      human-2 x MT fractions contained a prominent protein band that was identical to
      ferritin in molecular weight and cross-reacted with anti-human-2 x MT and
      anti-human-ferritin serums. However, antiserums to this ferritinlike protein, or 
      anti-ferritin, did not stain neurofibrillary tangles. Although neither the calf 2
      x MT nor two other human MT fractions failed to elicit an antiserum that stained 
      tangles, these fractions were able to remove the antihuman-2 x MT serum activity 
      that binds to tangles. The data suggest that the protein (or proteins) that makes
      up neurofibrillary tangles of SDAT is present in various quantities in
      microtubule fractions of normal brain.

PG  - 182-90
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) or sera or both from 57 chronic schizophrenics and 18 
      senile demented patients were examined by various tests for HBsAg. both CSF and
      serum were positive in 2 schizophrenics while in six HBsAg was detected in the
      CSF only. Elevated values of circulating immune complexes were found in positive 
      patients. Most CSF positive for HBsAg also contained neutralizing antibodies to
      Herpesvirus hominis type 1. Ultramicroscopic structures similar to hepatitis B
      virus (HBV) components and herpesviral particles were visualized in the CSF of
      one patient on electron microscope (EM) grids coated with anti-human IgG serum.
      Most HBsAg positive patients appeared to be liver-symptoms-free carriers. In the 
      CSF of a 79 years old senile demented man HBsAg was proved serologically. Several
      herpesviral particles complexed with globular material and spherical structures
      for 15 to 25 nm in diameter were visualized in the same CSF on EM grids coated
      with anti-human IgG serum. The findings support the importance of herpesviruses
      in mental illness. Penetration of HBsAg through the blood-brian barrier might be 
      involved as an iatrogenic factor in the course of late psychoses.

TI  - Cytochemistry of brain amyloid in adult dementia.
PG  - 189-96
AB  - A cytochemical study of 14 cases of adult dementia revealed the presence of gamma
      globulin in the amyloid of three cases of congophilic angiopathy by means of
      immunofluorescence microscopy. In these cases, the additional identification of
      human albumin is regarded to indicate a non-specific macromolecular leak in the
      blood-brain barrier. Both reactions are inhibited by prior absorption with the
      appropriate serum protein. Twelve of the 14 cases had congophilic amyloid
      deposits which were not affected by permanganate pre-treatment, so that
      immunoglobulin content remains a possibility, despite the negative immune
      reaction. Alcianophilia was studied at a varying pH and electrolyte
      concentration, but these findings do not appear to have nosologic significance.
      The three positive cases are characterized by a rapid terminal decline. The
      heterogeneity of amyloid and the significance of immunoamyloid in the
      pathogenesis of adult dementia is discussed.

PG  - 778-82
AB  - Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a protein that is associated with 9-nm
      filaments of astrocytes, was observed to be increased in the astrocytes
      surrounding senile plaques in patients with Alzheimer dementia and in aged
      subjects without dementia. A few GFAP-positive fibers were seen in the centers of
      plaques. These results emphasized the selectivity of senile changes; whereas some
      cells seemed to undergo degeneration or dysfunction, other
      cells--astrocytes--maintain their capacity for reaction and may increase the
      formation of at least one protein, GFAP.

TI  - Adult dementia: history, biopsy, pathology.
PG  - 434-42
AB  - The historical events in the evolution of Alzheimer's disease are reviewed,
      including the initial description by Alois Alzheimer and the subsequent
      controversy regarding the nosological specificity of this entity. The similarity 
      of senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease is emphasized. The basis for the
      modern concept of Alzheimer's disease as premature or accelerated aging is
      included in the review. The pathological correlates of the major categories of
      adult dementia have been described. The traditional criteria of neurofibrillary
      tangles and senile plaques have been re-evaluated using the current insight into 
      these changes afforded by electron microscopy and biochemistry. The significance 
      of amyloid has been described because it occurs within the senile plaque and also
      as the essential component of congophilic angiopathy. The new information
      regarding neuronal cell counts and the loss of choline acetyltransferase has been
      evaluated in terms of an indication of a pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's
      disease. The current understanding of normal pressure hydrocephalus,
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and multi-infarct dementia has been described. Brain
      biopsy in dementia has been described as having diagnostic, research, pathogenic,
      and prognostic value. The precautions involving the performance and handling of
      the biopsy have been stressed, particularly because these procedures involve
      conditions of possible slow virus etiology. The polemic for Alzheimer's disease
      as aging or slow virus infection has been summarized. At this time a
      consideration seems justified that Alzheimer's disease is an age-related, slow
      virus disease due to a hitherto unknown immune defect. Aging as an etiological
      agent must be clarified before Alzheimer's disease, in any form, can be
      considered to be an inevitable consequence of longevity.

      indistinguishable from that found in presenile dementia of the Alzheimer type.
      Consideration of the neuropathological changes suggest that this disease may
      involve in interaction of at least three processes: a viral-like infection, a
      disorder in the immune system and the neurotoxic effect of an environmental
      agent. The evidence in support of this hypothesis is reviewed.

AB  - A study into the relationship of immune change in the serum and the presence of
      senile dementia is reported. Three groups were studied, senile dementia,
      cerebrovascular disease and subjects without evidence of brain disease. All were 
      aged 65 years and over. The immunofluorescent studies showed an excess of
      antineuronal reactivity and a fall in antinuclear antibody in females with senile
      dementia. There was no significant difference between the groups in respect of
      immunoglobulins, slide latex and a complement fixation test, against a variety of
      tissues. The significance of the findings in relation to other published results 
      is discussed.
