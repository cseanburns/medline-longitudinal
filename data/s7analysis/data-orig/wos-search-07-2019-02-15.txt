AB Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections. Although comorbid UTI in geriatric patients with delirium or dementia is well known, the prevalence and scope of the association with other neuropsychiatric disorders is unclear. We performed a systematic review of the association between UTIs and delirium, dementia, psychotic disorders, and mood disorders in hospitalized patients. We identified studies by searching PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Knowledge, and the reference lists of identified studies and review papers. Seventeen publications met the inclusion criteria. The primary findings were: (1) 88% of publications reported a positive association between UTIs and neuropsychiatric disorders; (2) 47% reported that the clinical course of a neuropsychiatric disorder may be precipitated or exacerbated by a UTI; (3) the mean weighted prevalence of UTIs in subjects was 19.4% for delirium, 11.2% for dementia, 21.7% for nonaffective psychotic disorders, and 17.8% for mood disorders. Our findings, which must be interpreted carefully given the heterogeneity among the studies, suggest that UTIs are highly comorbid in hospitalized patients and may precipitate or exacerbate some neuropsychiatric disorders. The association extends beyond geriatric patients with delirium, affects males and females, and includes adults with psychotic and mood disorders. These findings underscore the important interface between physical and mental health. Potential underlying mechanisms are also reviewed, including complex interactions between the immune system and the brain.

AB Dementia is a neurodegenerative condition of the brain in which there is a progressive and permanent loss of cognitive and mental performance. Despite the fact that the number of people with dementia worldwide is steadily increasing and regardless of the advances in the molecular characterization of the disease, current medical treatments for dementia are purely symptomatic and hardly effective. We present a novel multi-relational association mining method that integrates the huge amount of scientific data accumulated in recent years to predict potential novel targets for innovative therapeutic treatment of dementia. Owing to the ability of processing large volumes of heterogeneous data, our method achieves a high performance and predicts numerous drug targets including several serine threonine kinase and a G-protein coupled receptor. The predicted drug targets are mainly functionally related to metabolism, cell surface receptor signaling pathways, immune response, apoptosis, and long-term memory. Among the highly represented kinase family and among the G-protein coupled receptors, DLG4 (PSD-95), and the bradikynin receptor 2 are highlighted also for their proposed role in memory and cognition, as described in previous studies. These novel putative targets hold promises for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of dementia.

AB We provide microarray data comparing genome-wide differential expression and pathology throughout life in four lines of "amyloid" transgenic mice (mutant human APP, PSEN1, or APP/PSEN1) and "TAU" transgenic mice (mutant human MAPT gene). Microarray data were validated by qPCR and by comparison to human studies, including genome-wide association study (GWAS) hits. Immune gene expression correlated tightly with plaques whereas synaptic genes correlated negatively with neurofibrillary tangles. Network analysis of immune gene modules revealed six hub genes in hippocampus of amyloid mice, four in common with cortex. The hippocampal network in TAU mice was similar except that Trem2 had hub status only in amyloid mice. The cortical network of TAU mice was entirely different with more hub genes and few in common with the other networks, suggesting reasons for specificity of cortical dysfunction in FTDP17.

AB The non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder which is very common world wide. The human gut harbors microbiota which has a wide variety of microbial organisms; they are mainly symbiotic and important for well being. However, "dysbiosis" - i.e. an alteration in normal commensal gut microbiome with an increase in pathogenic microbes, impacts homeostasis/health. Dysbiosis in NCGS causes gut inflammation, diarrhea, constipation, visceral hypersensitivity, abdominal pain, dysfunctional metabolic state, and peripheral immune and neuro-immune communication. Thus, immune-mediated gut and extra-gut dysfunctions, due to gluten sensitivity with comorbid diarrhea, may last for decades. A significant proportion of NCGS patients may chronically consume alcohol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and fatty diet, as well as suffer from various comorbid disorders. The above pathophysiological substrate and dysbiosis are underpinned by dysfunctional bidirectional "Gut-Brain Axis" pathway. Pathogenic gut microbiota is known to upregulate gut- and systemic inflammation (due to lipopolysaccharide from pathogenic bacteria and synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines); they enhance energy harvest, cause obesity, insulin resistance, and dysfunctional vago-vagal gut-brain axis. Conceivably, the above cascade of pathology may promote various pathophysiological mechanisms, neuroinflammation, and cognitive dysfunction. Hence, dysbiosis, gut inflammation, and chronic dyshomeostasis are of great clinical relevance. It is argued here that we need to be aware of NCGS and its chronic pathophysiological impact. Therapeutic measures including probiotics, vagus nerve stimulation, antioxidants, alpha 7 nicotinic receptor agonists, and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 antagonist may ameliorate neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in NCGS; they may therefore, prevent cognitive dysfunction and vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease.

AB BACKGROUND: The majority of people with Down syndrome (DS) develop dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuropathological features are characterized by an accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits and the presence of an activated immune response. Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) is a newly identified (neuro)inflammatory constituent in AD.; OBJECTIVE: This study examines NGAL as an inflammatory marker in DS and its associations with plasma Abeta peptides according to the follow-up clinical diagnosis of dementia.; METHODS: Baseline serum NGAL and plasma Abeta40, Abeta42, Abeta(n40), and Abeta(n42) were quantified in 204 people with DS. The diagnosis of dementia in DS was established by follow-up clinical assessments. The following study groups were characterized: DS with AD at baseline (n = 67), DS without AD (n = 53), and non-demented DS individuals that converted to AD (n = 84). Serum NGAL was analyzed in 55 elderly non-DS, non-demented people.; RESULTS: Serum NGAL levels were significantly increased in DS subjects compared to non-DS people. Serum NGAL levels were not associated with clinical dementia symptoms in DS. However, NGAL was positively associated with Abeta42 and Abeta(n42) in demented DS individuals and with Abeta40 and Abeta(n40) in the non-demented DS group. NGAL was negatively associated with Abeta42/Abeta40 and Abeta(n42)/Abeta(n40) ratios in converted DS subjects. These associations persisted for Abeta(n40), Abeta42/Abeta40, and Abeta(n42)/Abeta(n40) after adjusting for demographics measures, apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele, platelets, and anti-inflammatory medication.; CONCLUSION: Serum NGAL levels are increased in DS and associated with distinct species of Abeta depending on the progression of dementia as diagnosed by baseline and follow-up clinical assessments.

AB Cerebral white matter lesions (WML) are common in the aging brain and are associated with dementia and depression. They are associated with vascular risk factors and small vessel disease, suggesting an ischemic origin, but recent pathology studies suggest a more complex pathogenesis. Studies using samples from the population-representative Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study neuropathology cohort used post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging to identify WML for further study. Expression of hypoxia-related molecules and other injury and protective cellular pathways in candidate immunohistochemical and gene expression microarray studies support a role for hypoxia/ischemia. However, these approaches also suggest that immune activation, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, altered cell metabolic pathways and glial cell injury contribute to pathogenesis. These abnormalities are not confined to WML, but are also found in apparently normal white matter in brains with lesions, suggesting a field effect of white matter abnormality within which lesions arise. WML are an active pathology with a complex pathogenesis that may potentially offer a number of primary and secondary intervention targets.  © 2014 International Society of Neuropathology.

AB Frailty syndrome is defined as extreme stress vulnerability and decreased potential to adapt. The elderly and chronically ill patients are affected mostly. This condition increases the risk of adverse health outcomes as infections, falls, delirium, institutionalization, progression of comorbidities and mortality. The pathophysiological mechanism is a complex immune and neuroendocrine dysregulation. According to the phenotype model, frailty presents when three of the followings occur: weakness, exhaustion, slowness, weight loss and decreased activity, while cumulative model counts the number of health deficits. Aging, frailty, dementia and depression are independent clinical entities; they may present separately but may also potentiate each other. Hence most of the frailty scales assess the physical, mental and social dimensions as well. Mild or moderate frailty is potentially reversible with an individualised caring plan. Given short, easy-to-use screening tools, risk groups can be identified in the primary care and referred to a specialised team for further treatment. Here the authors summarise the literature of a re-discovered, current clinical phenomena, frailty syndrome, focusing on the practical issues in primary care.

AB PURPOSE: Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE) is a rare, immune-mediated entity. We present an unusual case of a patient who has double cancers and two different paraneoplastic neurological syndromes.; CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old gentleman has histories of adenocarcinoma of lung and malignant thymoma associated with myasthenia gravis, which underwent surgery and chemotherapy 3 years ago. This time, he presented to our ward with rapidly progressive memory decline and myoclonic jerks in his limbs for two weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain showed increased signal intensity over bilateral mesial temporal regions on T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recover (FLAIR) series. Chest computed tomography showed cancer recurrence. He received steroid pulse therapy firstly and right lung lower lobe lobectomy later. Pathology report of the tumor was recurrent adenocarcinoma. After the immunotherapy and tumor resection, his mentality improved gradually. Six months later, brain MRI showed resolution of bilateral temporal hyperintensity with residual mesial temporal atrophy.; CONCLUSION: From our case, we would like to emphasize that paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis should be considered among the differential diagnosis of rapidly progressive dementia associated with myoclonus, along with other neurodegenerative diseases. Depending on its underlying malignancy, the cognitive impairment may be substantially reversible, despite atrophy of mesial temporal lobes.

AB BACKGROUND: Chronic stress negatively affects health and well-being. A growing population of informal dementia caregivers experience chronic stress associated with extraordinary demands of caring for a relative with dementia. This review summarizes physiological and functional changes due to chronic dementia caregiver stress.; METHODS: A literature search for papers assessing effects of dementia caregiving was conducted focusing on publications evaluating differences between caregivers and non-caregivers in objective measures of health and cognition.; RESULTS: The review identified 37 studies describing data from 4,145 participants including 749 dementia caregivers and 3,396 non-caregiver peers. Objective outcome measures affected in dementia caregivers included markers of dyscoagulation, inflammation, and cell aging as well as measures of immune function, sleep, and cognition. Though diverse in designs, samples, and study quality, the majority of the studies indicated increased vulnerability of dementia caregivers to detrimental changes in health and cognition. Demographic and personality characteristics moderating or mediating effects of chronic stress in caregivers were also reviewed.; CONCLUSIONS: There is accumulating evidence that chronic dementia caregiver stress increases their vulnerability to disease and diminishes their ability to provide optimal care. Clinicians and society need to appreciate the extent of deleterious effects of chronic stress on dementia caregiver health.

AB The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder world wide that lasts for decades. The human gut harbors a diverse population of microbial organisms which is symbiotic and important for well being. However, studies on conventional, germ-free, and obese animals have shown that alteration in normal commensal gut microbiota and an increase in pathogenic microbiota-termed "dysbiosis", impact gut function, homeostasis, and health. Diarrhea, constipation, visceral hypersensitivity, and abdominal pain arise in IBS from the gut-induced dysfunctional metabolic, immune, and neuro-immune communication. Dysbiosis in IBS is associated with gut inflammation. Gut-related inflammation is pivotal in promoting endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, and neuroinflammation. A significant proportion of IBS patients chronically consume alcohol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, and fatty diet; they may also suffer from co-morbid respiratory, neuromuscular, psychological, sleep, and neurological disorders. The above pathophysiological substrate is underpinned by dysbiosis, and dysfunctional bidirectional "Gut-Brain Axis" pathways. Pathogenic gut microbiota-related systemic inflammation (due to increased lipopolysaccharide and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and barrier dysfunction), may trigger neuroinflammation enhancing dysfunctional brain regions including hippocampus and cerebellum. These as well as dysfunctional vago-vagal gut-brain axis may promote cognitive impairment. Indeed, inflammation is characteristic of a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that manifest demntia. It is argued that an awareness of pathophysiological impact of IBS and implementation of appropriate therapeutic measures may prevent cognitive impairment and minimize vulnerability to dementia.

AB Most dementias begin insidiously, developing slowly and generally occurring in the elderly age group. The so-called rapidly progressive dementias constitute a different, diverse collection of conditions, many of which are reversible or treatable. For this reason, prompt identification and assessment of acute and subacute forms of dementia are critical to effective treatment. Numerous other entities within this category of presenile rapid-onset dementias are untreatable such as the prion-related diseases. Neuroimaging aids in the diagnosis and evaluation of many of these rapidly progressive dementias, which include myriad conditions ranging from variations of more common neurodegenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia; infectious-related dementias such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome dementia; autoimmune and malignancy-related conditions; to toxic and metabolic forms of encephalopathy. This first of a 2-part review will specifically address the ability of MR imaging and ancillary neuroimaging strategies to support the diagnostic evaluation of rapidly progressive dementias due to neurodegenerative causes.

AB Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic immune-mediated disease which goes along with serious somatic and psychic symptoms. Whereas recent research rather focussed on the neurological symptoms of MS, there is nowadays an increasing interest among researchers in psychological symptoms of the disease. It is known that about half of the MS patients suffer from cognitive deficits, and that cognitive decline has a disadvantageous impact on lifestyle and quality of life in affected persons. So far, cognitive deficits in subjects with MS have been described as rather isolated, specific cognitive disturbances with otherwise intact intellectual abilities, while global deterioration of mental skills in terms of dementia is considered as being rather rare. In the present article, we describe cognitive domains which are typically impaired in subjects with MS and reflect on the question if the diagnosis of dementia might be underrepresented in MS patients due to several reasons (e.g., progression of cognitive deficits in the course of the disorder, adhering very closely to memory deficits as cardinal symptom of dementia, lack of longitudinal studies of cognitive performance levels). Furthermore, we recommend a multistage neuropsychological diagnostic procedure for clinical practice which aims at diagnosing cognitive deficits already in early stages of the illness. In so doing, practitioners may be able to offer adequate therapies to affected persons in all stages of the disorder in order to improve psychosocial functional levels. ©Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

AB RATIONALE: Relationships between chronic health conditions and acute infections remain poorly understood. Preclinical studies suggest crosstalk between nervous and immune systems.; OBJECTIVES: To determine bidirectional relationships between cognition and pneumonia.; METHODS: We conducted longitudinal analyses of a population-based cohort over 10 years. We determined whether changes in cognition increase risk of pneumonia hospitalization by trajectory analyses and joint modeling. We then determined whether pneumonia hospitalization increased risk of subsequent dementia using a Cox model with pneumonia as a time-varying covariate.; MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 5,888 participants, 639 (10.9%) were hospitalized with pneumonia at least once. Most participants had normal cognition before pneumonia. Three cognition trajectories were identified: no, minimal, and severe rapid decline. A greater proportion of participants hospitalized with pneumonia were on trajectories of minimal or severe decline before occurrence of pneumonia compared with those never hospitalized with pneumonia (proportion with no, minimal, and severe decline were 67.1%, 22.8%, and 10.0% vs. 76.0%, 19.3%, and 4.6% for participants with and without pneumonia, respectively; P < 0.001). Small subclinical changes in cognition increased risk of pneumonia, even in those with normal cognition and physical function before pneumonia (beta = -0.02; P < 0.001). Participants with pneumonia were subsequently at an increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio, 2.24 [95% confidence interval, 1.62-3.11]; P = 0.01). Associations were independent of demographics, health behaviors, other chronic conditions, and physical function. Bidirectional relationship did not vary based on severity of disease, and similar associations were noted for those with severe sepsis and other infections.; CONCLUSIONS: A bidirectional relationship exists between pneumonia and cognition and may explain how a single episode of infection in well-appearing older individuals accelerates decline in chronic health conditions and loss of functional independence.

AB Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that are based on the misfolding of a cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) into an infectious, pathological conformation (PrP(Sc)). There is proof-of-principle evidence that a prion vaccine is possible but this is tempered with concerns of the potential dangers associated with induction of immune responses to a widely-expressed self-protein. By targeting epitopes that are specifically exposed upon protein misfolding, our group developed a vaccine that induces PrP(Sc)-specific antibody responses. Here we consider the ability of this polyclonal antibody (SN6b) to bind to a mutant of PrP(C) associated with spontaneous prion disease. Polyclonal antibodies were selected to mimic the vaccination outcome and also explore all possible protein conformations of the recombinant bovine prion protein with mutation T194A [bPrP(T194A)]. This mutant is a homolog of the human T183A mutation of PrP(C) that is associated with early onset of familial dementia. With nanopore analysis, under non-denaturing conditions, we observed binding of the SN6b antibody to bPrP(T194A). This interaction was confirmed through ELISAs as well as immunoprecipitation of the recombinant and cellularly expressed forms of bPrP(T194A). This interaction did not promote formation of a protease resistant conformation of PrP in vitro. Collectively, these findings support the disease-specific approach for immunotherapy of prion diseases but also suggest that the concept of conformation-specific immunotherapy may be complicated in individuals who are genetically predisposed to PrP(C) misfolding.

AB BACKGROUND: Although yoga and meditation have been used for stress reduction with reported improvement in inflammation, little is known about the biological mechanisms mediating such effects. The present study examined if a yogic meditation might alter the activity of inflammatory and antiviral transcription control pathways that shape immune cell gene expression.; METHODS: Forty-five family dementia caregivers were randomized to either Kirtan Kriya Meditation (KKM) or Relaxing Music (RM) listening for 12 min daily for 8 weeks and 39 caregivers completed the study. Genome-wide transcriptional profiles were collected from peripheral blood leukocytes sampled at baseline and 8-week follow-up. Promoter-based bioinformatics analyses tested the hypothesis that observed transcriptional alterations were structured by reduced activity of the pro-inflammatory nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB family of transcription factors and increased activity of Interferon Response Factors (IRFs; i.e., reversal of patterns previously linked to stress).; RESULTS: In response to KKM treatment, 68 genes were found to be differentially expressed (19 up-regulated, 49 down-regulated) after adjusting for potentially confounded differences in sex, illness burden, and BMI. Up-regulated genes included immunoglobulin-related transcripts. Down-regulated transcripts included pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation-related immediate-early genes. Transcript origin analyses identified plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B lymphocytes as the primary cellular context of these transcriptional alterations (both p<.001). Promoter-based bioinformatic analysis implicated reduced NF-kappaB signaling and increased activity of IRF1 in structuring those effects (both p<.05).; CONCLUSION: A brief daily yogic meditation intervention may reverse the pattern of increased NF-kappaB-related transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased IRF1-related transcription of innate antiviral response genes previously observed in healthy individuals confronting a significant life stressor.

AB We have constructed a latent dementia proxy, "delta", and validated it in several datasets, including well characterized subjects participating in the Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium (TARCC) study. It may be possible to construct delta homologs from almost any ad hoc combination of cognitive and functional status measures. delta homologs may also be relatively immune to measurement error, including cultural, linguistic, or educational biases. These properties make factor scores derived from latent variables a potentially attractive solution for dementia case-finding in rural or minority populations. Here we have explored an alternative and briefer assessment by which to construct a delta homolog and validate the resulting latent variable (dMA) in Mexican-American (MA) TARCC subjects. dMA, composed of simple "bedside" dementia screening instruments, achieves Areas Under the Receiver Operative Curve that rival those of delta itself. Ethnicity has a small effect on dMA's performance. These results suggest that it may be possible to validly export dMA into other MA populations, or to export delta homolog factor scores from one population to another.

AB BACKGROUND: This study examined the effects of brief daily yogic meditation on mental health, cognitive functioning, and immune cell telomerase activity in family dementia caregivers with mild depressive symptoms.; METHODS: Thirty-nine family dementia caregivers (mean age 60.3 years old (SD = 10.2)) were randomized to practicing Kirtan Kriya or listening to relaxation music for 12 min per day for 8 weeks. The severity of depressive symptoms, mental and cognitive functioning were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Telomerase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBC) was examined in peripheral PBMC pre-intervention and post-intervention.; RESULTS: The meditation group showed significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms and greater improvement in mental health and cognitive functioning compared with the relaxation group. In the meditation group, 65.2% showed 50% improvement on the Hamilton Depression Rating scale and 52% of the participants showed 50% improvement on the Mental Health Composite Summary score of the Short Form-36 scale compared with 31.2% and 19%, respectively, in the relaxation group (p < 0.05). The meditation group showed 43% improvement in telomerase activity compared with 3.7% in the relaxation group (p = 0.05).; CONCLUSION: This pilot study found that brief daily meditation practices by family dementia caregivers can lead to improved mental and cognitive functioning and lower levels of depressive symptoms. This improvement is accompanied by an increase in telomerase activity suggesting improvement in stress-induced cellular aging. These results need to be confirmed in a larger sample.

AB Accumulating evidence suggests that levels of inflammation, an immune response, increase with age throughout the body and the brain. The effects of inflammation on the brain, both acute and chronic, have been associated with cognitive decline and risk of dementia in older adults. Factors believed to increase inflammation include certain health-related behaviors, such as smoking, poor diet, and inactivity as well as health conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, most of which require medical intervention and monitoring. As such, nurses and healthcare professionals are likely to encounter patients who are at a high risk for future development of inflammation-related cognitive decline. A review of inflammatory processes and their relation to cognitive function in older adults is provided, along with factors that may increase or reduce inflammation. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

AB The increased life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals due to improved treatment has revealed an unexpected increase in non-AIDS comorbidities that are typically associated with older age including cardiovascular disease, dementia and frailty. The majority of these diseases arise as the result of dysregulated systemic inflammation, and both the aged and HIV-infected individuals exhibit elevated basal levels of inflammation. In the elderly, increased inflammation and age-related diseases are associated with a state of impaired immunity called immunosenescence, which is thought to result from a lifetime of immune stimulation. It is now apparent that HIV induces premature immunosenescence within T-cells; however, the impact of HIV on aging of cells of the innate arm of the immune system is unknown. Innate immune cells play a central role in inflammation and are thus critical for the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Limited evidence suggests HIV infection mimics age-related changes to innate immune cells; however, the extent of this effect and the mechanism underlying these changes remain to be defined. This review focuses on the impact of HIV infection on the function and aging of innate immune cells and discusses potential drivers of premature immunosenescence including chronic endotoxaemia, residual viraemia, telomere attrition and altered cellular signalling.

AB OBJECTIVE: Heightened awareness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) among physicians and the lay public has led to its frequent consideration in the differential diagnosis of patients with rapidly progressive dementia (RPD). Our goal was to determine which treatable disorders are most commonly mistaken for CJD.; METHODS: We performed a retrospective clinical and neuropathological review of prion-negative brain autopsy cases referred to the US National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center at Case Western Reserve University from January 2006 through December 2009.; RESULTS: Of 1,106 brain autopsies, 352 (32%) were negative for prion disease, 304 of which had adequate tissue for histopathological analysis. Alzheimer disease (n = 154) and vascular dementia (n = 36) were the 2 most frequent diagnoses. Seventy-one patients had potentially treatable diseases. Clinical findings included dementia (42 cases), pyramidal (n = 20), cerebellar (n = 14), or extrapyramidal (n = 12) signs, myoclonus (n = 12), visual disturbance (n = 9), and akinetic mutism (n = 5); a typical electroencephalogram occurred only once. Neuropathological diagnoses included immune-mediated disorders (n = 26), neoplasia (n = 25, most often lymphoma), infections (n = 14), and metabolic disorders (n = 6).; INTERPRETATION: In patients with RPD, treatable disorders should be considered and excluded before diagnosing CJD. Misdiagnosed patients often did not fulfill World Health Organization criteria. RPD with positive 14-3-3 cerebrospinal fluid protein should not be regarded as sufficient for the diagnosis of CJD. Adherence to revised criteria for CJD, which include distinctive magnetic resonance imaging features of prion disease, is likely to improve diagnostic accuracy.

AB Cognitive disorders such as dementia, attention deficits, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been well investigated. However, effective interventions for the promotion and progression of AD are unavailable to date. The present work was undertaken to investigate the effects of the aqueous (300 and 500 mg/kg) and alcoholic (300 and 500 mg/kg) extracts of Ocimum sanctum Linn. leaves as an antidementic and anticholinesterase agent and also as an immunostimulant in rats. Maximal electroshock, atropine, and cyclosporine were used to induce dementia. The passive avoidance task was used for assessing memory. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was estimated in different parts of the brain, and immune status was studied using dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) skin sensitivity tests. In all the three models both aqueous and alcoholic O. sanctum extracts decreased the time taken to reach the shock-free zone and the number of mistakes and significantly decreased the AChE activity in rats. O. sanctum treatment significantly increased the induration in the DNCB skin test. Therefore, O. sanctum was shown to be useful for the management of experimentally induced cognitive dysfunctions in rats.

AB Thirty-three inpatients (22 females, 11 males, aged 79.4 ± 9.5 years) were investigated in this prospective cohort study to study the prevalence of polyneuropathy (PNP) and dementia in geriatric inpatients. Clinical and electrodiagnostic investigations, routine laboratory, including thyroid parameters, folic acid, vitamin B(12), homocysteine, neopterin, fibrinogen and glycosylated hemoglobin were measured in serum, the mini-mental state examination and computed tomographic scanning were performed in each patient. PNP was found clinically and electrodiagnostically in 96% of patients. Age was the most precipitating factor for PNP, and was significantly correlated to electrodiagnostic changes in the nerves investigated in both, upper and lower extremities, while clinical symptoms were confined only to the feet. Correlation was seen between homocysteine and the amplitude of the sural nerve (surAmpl) (rs = -0.406, p = 0.029) as well as the sural nerve conduction velocity (surNCV) (rs = -0.389, p = 0.037), and between neopterin and the grade of denervation (rs = 0.445, p = 0.014) in our patients. Neopterin and fibrinogen did not correlate significantly, but there was a trend to higher fibrinogen concentrations in patients with higher neopterin levels (rs = 0.344, p = 0.062). A trend of a correlation was seen between higher homocysteine concentrations and the number of changes in electrodiagnostic measurements (rs = 0.354, p = 0.055). Twenty-one of the 33 patients (64%) were demented, 9 (27%) presented clinically as mild cognitive impairment, 3 (9%) were not demented. Vascular risk factors were found in 83%: hypertension in 58%, hypercholesterinemia in 39%, cardiac disease in 36%, diabetes mellitus (DM) in 21%, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in 9%. A significant correlation was found between homocysteine and folic acid concentrations (rs = -0.401, p = 0.028). Falls were reported in 48% of cases, indicating PNP as a risk factor in this group of patients. In conclusion, PNP was found very common with a high coincidence with dementia and a female preponderance, suggesting an influence on daily life (falls) in our subjects studied. PNP correlated significantly with markers for vascular disease as well as immune activation (homocysteine and neopterin) similar to earlier findings in patients with neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting common therapeutic options in patients with PNP and dementia.

AB BACKGROUND: Smoking is a risk factor for several life-threatening diseases, but its long-term association with dementia is controversial and somewhat understudied. Our objective was to investigate the long-term association of amount of smoking in middle age on the risk of dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD) several decades later in a large, diverse population.; METHODS: We analyzed prospective data from a multiethnic population-based cohort of 21,123 members of a health care system who participated in a survey between 1978 and 1985. Diagnoses of dementia, AD, and VaD made in internal medicine, neurology, and neuropsychology were collected from January 1, 1994, to July 31, 2008. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the association between midlife smoking and risk of dementia, AD, and VaD.; RESULTS: A total of 5367 people (25.4%) were diagnosed as having dementia (including 1136 cases of AD and 416 cases of VaD) during a mean follow-up period of 23 years. Results were adjusted for age, sex, education, race, marital status, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, body mass index, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and alcohol use. Compared with nonsmokers, those smoking more than 2 packs a day had an elevated risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.14; 95% CI, 1.65-2.78), AD (adjusted HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.63-4.03), and VaD (adjusted HR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.20-6.18).; CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort, heavy smoking in midlife was associated with a greater than 100% increase in risk of dementia, AD, and VaD more than 2 decades later. These results suggest that the brain is not immune to long-term consequences of heavy smoking.

AB We performed a survey of sequence variation in a series of 20 genes involved in inflammation-related pathways for association with dementia risk in twin and unrelated case-control samples consisting in total of 1462 Swedish dementia casesand 1929 controls. For a total of 218 tested genetic markers, strong evidence was obtained implicating a region near AGER and NOTCH4 on chromosome 6p with replication across both samples and maximum combined significance at marker rs1800625 (OR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.19-1.56, p = 1.36*10(-6)). Imputation of the associated genomic interval provided an improved signal atrs8365, near the 3UTR of AGER (p = 7.34*10(-7)). The associated region extends 120 kb encompassing 11 candidate genes.While AGER encodes a key receptor for amyloid-beta protein, an analysis of network context based upon genes now confirmed to contribute to dementia risk (AbetaPP, PSEN1, PSEN2, CR1, CLU, PICALM, and APOE) suggested strong functional coupling to NOTCH4, with no significant coupling to the remaining candidates. The implicated region occurs in the broad HLA locus on chromosome 6p, but associated markers were not in strong LD with known variants that regulate HLA gene function, suggesting that this may represent a signal distinct from immune-system pathways.

AB Inflammatory mechanisms have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. We therefore sought to study DNA sequence variation and serum levels of the potent inflammatory mediators Interleukin-6 (IL6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in relation to AD and dementia. Tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) were chosen to capture most variation in and around CRP and IL6 in 3937 elderly Swedish men and women (1,265 AD cases). A sub-set of the population (n = 723) with serum measurements of CRP and IL6 was included in 1) a nested case-control study of incident dementia cases, and 2) a case-control study of prevalent dementia cases. None of the SNPs or haplotypes was significantly associated with AD or dementia after correcting for multiple testing nor were elevated baseline levels of hsCRP or IL6 (measured on average 4.3 years before dementia onset) significantly associated with risk of future AD or dementia. However, prevalent AD cases had higher levels of IL6 (measured on average 5.5 years after dementia onset) than age- and gender-matched controls, OR 2.24 (95% CI 1.27-3.95), p-value 0.006. In summary, this data suggests that AD patients have an altered immune profile with higher circulating levels of IL6 than age- and gender-matched controls. However, neither variation in the CRP and IL6 genes nor circulating levels of their respective protein products were associated with an increased risk of developing late-life dementias.

AB OBJECTIVE: To define the diagnostic characteristics and predictors of treatment response in patients with suspected autoimmune dementia.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1, 2002, and January 1, 2009, 72 consecutive patients received immunotherapy for suspected autoimmune dementia. Their baseline clinical, radiologic, and serologic characteristics were reviewed and compared between patients who were responsive to immunotherapy and those who were not. Patients were classified as responders if the treating physician had reported improvement after immunotherapy (documented in 80% by the Kokmen Short Test of Mental Status, neuropsychological testing, or both).; RESULTS: Initial immunotherapeutic regimens included methylprednisolone in 56 patients (78%), prednisone in 12 patients (17%), dexamethasone in 2 patients (3%), intravenous immune globulin in 1 patient (1%), and plasma exchange in 1 patient (1%). Forty-six patients (64%) improved, most in the first week of treatment. Thirty-five percent of these immunotherapy responders were initially diagnosed as having a neurodegenerative or prion disorder. Pretreatment and posttreatment neuropsychological score comparisons revealed improvement in almost all cognitive domains, most notably learning and memory. Radiologic or electroencephalographic improvements were reported in 22 (56%) of 39 patients. Immunotherapy responsiveness was predicted by a subacute onset (P<.001), fluctuating course (P<.001), tremor (P=.007), shorter delay to treatment (P=.005), seropositivity for a cation channel complex autoantibody (P=.01; neuronal voltage-gated potassium channel more than calcium channel or neuronal acetylcholine receptor), and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein (>100 mg/dL) or pleocytosis (P=.02). Of 26 immunotherapy-responsive patients followed up for more than 1 year, 20 (77%) relapsed after discontinuing immunotherapy.; CONCLUSION: Identification of clinical and serologic clues to an autoimmune dementia allows early initiation of immunotherapy, and maintenance if needed, thus favoring an optimal outcome.

AB Vitamin D was initially thought only to function in calcium homeostasis. However, it has multiple roles in human health, including neuromuscular and immune modulation. Recently, its deficiency is increasingly implicated in many diseases. This discovery has led both popular culture and research to find ways that vitamin D can either treat or prevent many diseases. Since vitamin D not only affects the expression of many genes, but also has intra-individual pharmacokinetic variation, a simplistic cause and effect between vitamin D deficiency and illnesses should not be expected. Older adults pose a challenge not only because diseases become more prevalent with ageing, but they also are often complicated with other comorbidities. This article reviews the link of vitamin D deficiency and the associated medical conditions in middle aged and older adults. It also examines the variability in testing vitamin D values and evaluates dosing recommendations based on current evidence.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule that is widely used in the nervous system. With recognition of its roles in synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP; long-term depression, LTD) and elucidation of calcium-dependent, NMDAR-mediated activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), numerous molecular and pharmacological tools have been used to explore the physiology and pathological consequences for nitrergic signaling. In this review, the authors summarize the current understanding of this subtle signaling pathway, discuss the evidence for nitrergic modulation of ion channels and homeostatic modulation of intrinsic excitability, and speculate about the pathological consequences of spillover between different nitrergic compartments in contributing to aberrant signaling in neurodegenerative disorders. Accumulating evidence points to various ion channels and particularly voltage-gated potassium channels as signaling targets, whereby NO mediates activity-dependent control of intrinsic neuronal excitability; such changes could underlie broader mechanisms of synaptic plasticity across neuronal networks. In addition, the inability to constrain NO diffusion suggests that spillover from endothelium (eNOS) and/or immune compartments (iNOS) into the nervous system provides potential pathological sources of NO and where control failure in these other systems could have broader neurological implications. Abnormal NO signaling could therefore contribute to a variety of neurodegenerative pathologies such as stroke/excitotoxicity, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.

AB The cause of most glioblastomas is unknown. One cause might lie in the surrounding brain tissue. The interactions between glioblastoma cells and their micro- and macro-environment could create a context that promotes or suppresses tumor growth and protects or exposes the malignant cells to immune attack. Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a protein misfolding disorder (proteopathy), caused by accumulation of abnormally folded A-beta and tau proteins in the brain. These or other changed proteins or as yet unrecognized biochemical brain changes of dementia might promote glioblastoma development. Published data indicate that there is an association between Alzheimer's disease prevalence and malignant brain tumor incidence in 19 US states. Hypothetically, Alzheimer's and glioblastoma may share an as yet unknown peripheral tissue pathway that can promote the progression of both diseases. If this pathway can be identified, new treatments for both conditions may follow. Copyright  2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Telomerase activity plays an essential role in cell survival, by lengthening telomeres and promoting cell growth and longevity. It is now possible to quantify the low levels of telomerase activity in human leukocytes. Low basal telomerase activity has been related to chronic stress in people and to chronic glucocorticoid exposure in vitro. Here we test whether leukocyte telomerase activity changes under acute psychological stress. We exposed 44 elderly women, including 22 high stress dementia caregivers and 22 matched low stress controls, to a brief laboratory psychological stressor, while examining changes in telomerase activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). At baseline, caregivers had lower telomerase activity levels than controls, but during stress telomerase activity increased similarly in both groups. Across the entire sample, subsequent telomerase activity increased by 18% one hour after the end of the stressor (p<0.01). The increase in telomerase activity was independent of changes in numbers or percentages of monocytes, lymphocytes, and specific T cell types, although we cannot fully rule out some potential contribution from immune cell redistribution in the change in telomerase activity. Telomerase activity increases were associated with greater cortisol increases in response to the stressor. Lastly, psychological response to the tasks (greater threat perception) was also related to greater telomerase activity increases in controls. These findings uncover novel relationships of dynamic telomerase activity with exposure to an acute stressor, and with two classic aspects of the stress response - perceived psychological stress and neuroendocrine (cortisol) responses to the stressor.

AB Subjects with Down syndrome (DS) have abnormalities in virtually all aspects of the immune system and almost all will be affected with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is thought that nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the pathophysiology of AD. In the present study, including a total of 401 elderly DS subjects, the spectrum of plasma amino acids and neopterin was investigated and related to development of AD. Concentrations of nearly all amino acids in DS subjects differed significantly from those of healthy controls. Neopterin was increased in DS subjects, especially in dementia. The production of NO as reflected by an increased citrulline/arginine ratio (Cit/Arg ratio) was enhanced during development of clinical dementia. Neopterin concentrations correlated to the Cit/Arg ratio only in the group of prevalent demented subjects (rho = 0.48, P = 0.006). The results of this study are suggestive for an increase in oxidative processes in DS subjects with AD.

AB Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are immune-mediated effects of cancer that involve the nervous system and are associated with various anti-neuronal antibodies. They can be associated with several cancers such as lung, gynecologic, thymic, testicular and others, but the diagnosis of cancer often becomes a challenge, since paraneoplastic neurological syndromes usually precede the cancer presentation by months or even years. Furthermore, even when the cancer develops, the tumor size remains small and usually undetectable by conventional diagnostic tests and imaging. Positron emission tomography imaging may be an adjunct to timely diagnosis of the occult malignancy in order to employ the specific cancer treatment. Furthermore, positron emission tomography can assess the extent of the functional abnormality in the brain and monitor its response to treatment. Copyright 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB The human brain is nearly 60 percent fat. We've learned in recent years that fatty acids are among the most crucial molecules that determine your brain's integrity and ability to perform. Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are required for maintenance of optimal health but they can not synthesized by the body and must be obtained from dietary sources. Clinical observation studies has related imbalance dietary intake of fatty acids to impaired brain performance and diseases. Most of the brain growth is completed by 5-6 years of age. The EFAs, particularly the omega-3 fatty acids, are important for brain development during both the fetal and postnatal period. Dietary decosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is needed for the optimum functional maturation of the retina and visual cortex, with visual acuity and mental development seemingly improved by extra DHA. Beyond their important role in building the brain structure, EFAs, as messengers, are involved in the synthesis and functions of brain neurotransmitters, and in the molecules of the immune system. Neuronal membranes contain phospholipid pools that are the reservoirs for the synthesis of specific lipid messengers on neuronal stimulation or injury. These messengers in turn participate in signaling cascades that can either promote neuronal injury or neuroprotection. The goal of this review is to give a new understanding of how EFAs determine our brain's integrity and performance, and to recall the neuropsychiatric disorders that may be influenced by them. As we further unlock the mystery of how fatty acids affect the brain and better understand the brain's critical dependence on specific EFAs, correct intake of the appropriate diet or supplements becomes one of the tasks we undertake in pursuit of optimal wellness.

AB BACKGROUND: Recent findings suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathological features (neuritic plaques and NFTs) are not strongly associated with dementia in extreme old (over 90 years of age) and compel a search for neurobiological indices of dementia in this rapidly growing segment of the elderly population. We sought to characterize transcriptional and protein profiles of dementia in the oldest-old.; METHODS AND FINDINGS: Gene and protein expression changes relative to non-demented age-matched controls were assessed by two microarray platforms, qPCR and Western blot in different regions of the brains of oldest-old and younger old persons who died at mild or severe stages of dementia. Our results indicate that: i) consistent with recent neuropathological findings, gene expression changes associated with cognitive impairment in oldest-old persons are distinct from those in cognitively impaired youngest-old persons; ii) transcripts affected in young-old subjects with dementia participate in biological pathways related to synaptic function and neurotransmission while transcripts affected in oldest-old subjects with dementia are associated with immune/inflammatory function; iii) upregulation of immune response genes in cognitively intact oldest-old subjects and their subsequent downregulation in dementia suggests a potential protective role of the brain immune-associated system against dementia in the oldest-old; iv) consistent with gene expression profiles, protein expression of several selected genes associated with the inflammatory/immune system in inferior temporal cortex is significantly increased in cognitively intact oldest-old persons relative to cognitively intact young-old persons, but impaired in cognitively compromised oldest-old persons relative to cognitively intact oldest-old controls.; CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that disruption of the robust immune homeostasis that is characteristic of oldest-old individuals who avoided dementia may be directly associated with dementia in the oldest-old and contrast with the synaptic and neurotransmitter system failures that typify dementia in younger old persons.

AB The advancement of medical sciences during the last century has resulted in a considerable increase in life expectancy. As more people live to old age, one of the most fundamental questions of the 21st century is whether the number of individuals suffering from dementia will also continue to increase. Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for the majority of cases of dementia in the elderly, but there is currently no curative treatment available. Several strategies have been introduced for treatment, the most recent strategy of which was the immunization of patients using antibodies against Abeta, which is a naturally occurring, even though misfolded peptide in the AD brain. Both active and passive immunization routes have been shown to reduce the pathology associated with Abeta accumulation in brains of genetically designed animal models. However, despite tremendous efforts, no unequivocal proof of therapeutic efficacy could be shown in AD patients. Particularly, the persistence of the neurofibrillary tangles in immunized brains and the issue of inducing cerebral amyloid angiopathy are major limiting factors of antibody therapy. Furthermore, physical activity, a healthy immune system and nutritional habits are suggested to protect against the onset of age-associated dementia. Thus, accumulative evidence suggests that an early integrated strategy, combining pharmacological, immunological, nutritional and life-style factors, is the most pragmatic approach to delay the onset and progression of age-associated dementia.

AB Persons with Down syndrome show an altered immune response and an increased susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease. In a prospective study, we examined whether the plasma neopterin level, a marker for cell-mediated immune activation and inflammation, is associated with an increased risk of dementia in persons with Down syndrome. Plasma concentrations of neopterin were determined in a population-based study of 394 persons with Down syndrome, who were screened annually for dementia. We used Cox proportional hazards model to determine risk of dementia. Demented persons with Down syndrome have a significantly (p=0.05) higher plasma neopterin concentration than the non-demented. In the non-demented without autoimmune disorders, in those with a plasma level of neopterin above median, the risk to develop dementia increased to 1.83 (95% confidence interval: 1.04-3.20). High plasma neopterin level is an independent determinant of the risk of dementia in persons with Down syndrome.

AB OBJECTIVES: The number of couples facing a dementia diagnosis for one partner of the spousal dyad increases. Spousal caregiving can be a highly stressful experience associated with negative caregiver outcomes such as depression and poorer immune function. However, surprisingly little is known about how the illness and the required care effects patient's well-being and relational changes experienced by afflicted couples. The aim of this study was to provide a literature review on how the dyadic perspective is taken into account and on how dementia effects both parts of the dyad.; METHODS: In order to outline findings about individual and dyadic well-being of affected couples, we conducted a literature search to review the three types of studies. First, studies focusing on one partner's perspective, usually the perspective of the caregiver; second, studies including the caregiver's and partially the care receiver's view; third, studies directly referring to both partners' perspectives.; RESULTS: The majority of studies neglect the individual with dementia by exclusively assessing caregiver variables or only indirectly including patients' characteristics. Very few studies embrace dyadic and relational variables to execute how both partners experience the illness, spousal caregiving, and changes in the relationship. Despite the arguable validity of self reports of individuals with dementia, some studies demonstrated the usefulness of including both partners' perspectives.; DISCUSSION: Results indicate the urgent need of integrating the perspective of the individual with dementia to improve the understanding of the effects of dementia caregiving. Directly assessing the dyadic perspective of affected couples provides essential information for interventions.

AB Increasing evidence of pro-inflammatory mediator expression in major depressions indicate that inflammatory changes may play a role. If this is true, the efficacy of antidepressants may be partially attributable to suppression of inflammation. Various types of antidepressants can suppress serum and plasma levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in patients with major depression. Therefore they can inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by immune cells. These include glial cells, which are the main sources and targets of cytokines in the brain. This review summarizes the evidence showing that antidepressants have an anti-inflammatory potential. The putative mechanisms are also discussed. Because of the anti-inflammatory effects of antidepressants, they might also act as preventives for neurodegenerative dementias including Alzheimer's disease, where the pathogenesis involves chronic inflammation associated with activated microglia.

AB Dementia is characterized by a decline in cognitive faculties and occurrence of behavioral abnormalities which interfere with an individual's activities of daily living. Dementing disorders usually affect elderly individuals but may occur in individuals younger than 65 years (early-onset dementia or EOD). EOD is often misdiagnosed or its diagnosis is delayed due to the fact that it has a more varied differential diagnosis than late-onset dementia. EOD affects individuals at the height of their career and productivity and produces devastating consequences and financial loss for the patient's family as well as society. EOD is not uncommon and is diagnosed in up to a third of patients presenting with dementia. Most importantly, some of the causes of EOD are curable which makes the need for a specific and timely diagnosis crucial. The present chapter presents a systematic approach to the differential diagnosis of EOD and provides readers with the clinical and neuroimaging features of these disorders as well as important considerations for their diagnostic evaluation. Specifically, the nuances of assessing the history and examination are discussed with careful attention to the various methods of cognitive and behavioral evaluation. A step-wise approach to diagnostic testing is followed by a discussion of anatomical localization, which often aids in identifying specific etiologies. Finally, in order to organize the subject for the reader, the various etiologies are grouped under the general categories of vascular, infectious, toxic-metabolic, immune-mediated, neoplastic/metastatic, and neurodegenerative.

AB This review summarizes three controversial areas of clinical practice that were discussed in many articles that appeared in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition during the author's tenure as editor in chief. Controversy 1-obesity and high-fructose corn syrup. The increased frequency of obesity in the US is paralleled by increasing annual consumption of high-fructose corn syrup, an extracted sweetener that is routinely added to soft drinks and to many processed foods in the US diet. Metabolic studies implicate increased fructose consumption in increased body fat and obesity and with increased circulating triglyceride levels and hypercholesterolaemia in children. Controversy 2-folic acid fortification and supplements. Together with widespread use of supplemental multivitamins, fortification of the US diet with folic acid has resulted in high serum folate levels in much of the population, which may be associated with increased risk of cognitive decline in ageing people with low vitamin B12 status, decreased natural killer T-cell immune function and increased risk of recurrent advanced precancerous colorectal adenomas and breast cancer. Controversy 3-recommended intakes of vitamin D. Levels of serum 25(OH)D sufficient for fracture prevention are at least 75 nmol/l (30 ng/ml) but cannot be achieved by the current recommended dietary intakes in the US. A recent fracture risk prevention trial showed that the 4-year incidence of all cancers was reduced in US women who received high supplemental doses of both calcium and vitamin D.

AB BACKGROUND: Those with an Apolipoprotein APOE4 allele (APOE4) have lower C-reactive protein (CRP) than those without APOE4. Whether APOE4 modifies the effects of CRP on rate of all cause dementia, cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not established.; METHODS: All cause dementia and cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND) was determined over five follow up visits from 1998 to 2006 in an ongoing cohort of older Latinos. The association between high sensitivity CRP and dementia/CIND, all cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease by APOE4 status was examined in semi-parametric survival models with covariate adjustments.; RESULTS: CRP was significantly lower among those with APOE4 than in those without. Among those with APOE4, CRP was associated with lower rates of combined dementia/CIND (HR: 0.60, 95% CL: 0.20-0.91, p=0.03) from a fully adjusted model. Among those with no APOE4, there was no effect of CRP on dementia/CIND rates (HR: 0.94, 95% CL: 0.67-1.33).; CONCLUSIONS: Lower CRP in those with APOE4 may reflect immune effects of the APOE4 genotype. Higher CRP in those with APOE4 may be a marker of better immune function, leading to lower rate of dementia and AD.

AB BACKGROUND: Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a fatal, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy characterized by rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, ataxia and akinetic mutism. The underlying mechanism is believed to be a conformational change of a native prion protein which characteristically fails to provoke an immune response. Commensurate with the latter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) classically exhibits a non-inflammatory profile.; CASES: We report two patients with pathologically-proven sporadic CJD presenting with a significant CSF pleocytosis.; CONCLUSION: Although uncommon, the presence of an inflammatory CSF profile should not exclude the diagnosis of sporadic CJD.

AB Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) is a controversial neurological disorder that comprises a heterogenous group of neurological symptoms that manifest in patients with high titers of antithyroid antibodies. Clinical manifestations of HE may include encephalopathic features such as seizures, behavioral and psychiatric manifestations, movement disorders, and coma. Although it has been linked to cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis or thyroid dysfunction, the most common immunological feature of HE is the presence of high titers of antithyroglobulin or anti-TPO (antimicrosomal) antibodies. At present, it is unclear whether antithyroid antibodies represent an immune epiphenomenon in a subset of patients with encephalopathic processes or they are really associated with pathogenic mechanisms of the disorder. The significance of classifying encephalopathies under the term HE will be determined in the future once the relevance of the role of antithyroid antibodies is demonstrated or dismissed by more detailed experimental and immunopathological studies. The responsiveness of HE to steroids or other therapies such as plasmapheresis supports the hypothesis that this is a disorder that involves immune pathogenic mechanisms. Further controlled studies of the use of steroids, plasmapheresis, or immunosuppressant medications are needed in the future to prove the concept of the pathogenic role of antithyroid antibodies in HE.

AB Until recently, dogma dictated that the immune system and the central nervous system (CNS) live mostly separate, parallel lives, and any interactions between the two were assumed to be limited to extreme cases of pathological insult. It was only a decade ago that T cells in the injured brain were shown to play a protective rather than a destructive role. In this article, we explore the role of the immune system in the healthy brain, focusing on the key function that T lymphocytes have in the regulation of cognition. We discuss candidate mechanisms underlying T cell-mediated control of cognitive function in human cognitive diseases associated with immune decline, such as age- and HIV-related dementias, 'chemo-brain' and others.

AB OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the psychological and physiological impact of caring for a partner with fronto-temporal dementia (FTD). Carers were expected to exhibit greater stress and poorer psychological well-being in comparison with non-carers, and suppressed mucosal immunity.; METHOD: Twenty-five carers and 36 non-carers completed standardised psychological assessments of perceived stress, psychological well-being, coping and social support. Levels of mucosal immunity were assessed in saliva samples collected over the 3 days of the study, alongside daily assessments of stress, arousal and mood.; RESULTS: Informal carers as a group reported greater stress and poorer psychological well-being, but there was considerable variation, with some carers reporting better psychological functioning than non-carers. Immune levels were not suppressed in carers compared with non-carers; counter to hypothesis, there was a positive correlation between immunity and poorer psychological well-being.; CONCLUSIONS: This research suggests that caring for a partner with FTD increases distress and carers might benefit from psychological intervention. However, the variation in psychological well-being requires explanation. Furthermore, this first examination of mucosal immunity employing participants experiencing enduring stress suggests that, in contrast to previous research, enduring stress does not lead to suppression of mucosal immunity and may actually enhance it.

AB Chronic stressors such as caregiving have been associated with reduced antibody production after vaccination and elevated interleukin (IL)-6 in older adults. However, individual differences in repetitive thought, that is, frequent or prolonged thought about oneself and one's world, can modify perception and effects of stress. For example, worry during stressful circumstances has been associated with poorer immune outcomes, whereas cognitive processing has been associated with better outcomes. The present study tested the relationship of caregiving and two types of repetitive thought, negative (e.g., worry) and neutral (e.g., reflection), to pre- and post-influenza vaccine antibody and IL-6. Dementia caregivers (n=14) and controls (n=30) were interviewed and had blood drawn pre- and post-vaccine in a multi-wave study. Multi-level models found that caregivers had higher IL-6 than controls after vaccination (t(23)=2.36, p<.05). There were several interactions between caregiver status and repetitive thought in predicting both depression and immune responses to vaccination. Among caregivers, negative repetitive thought predicted more depression and lower antibody titers, whereas neutral repetitive thought predicted less depression and higher antibody titers, but also higher post-vaccination IL-6. Among controls, negative repetitive thought predicted more depression but higher antibody titers, whereas neutral repetitive thought predicted less depression and lower post-vaccination IL-6. In mediational tests, depression did not account for the effects of repetitive thought. Results generally support beneficial effects of neutral repetitive thought and detrimental effects of negative repetitive thought, but those effects may be reduced or even reversed depending on life circumstances.

AB Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are often associated with severe and debilitating neurological problems that include behavioral abnormalities, motor dysfunction and frank dementia. HIV-1-infected peripheral immune cells, in particular macrophages, appear to infiltrate the CNS, release neurotoxins and provoke a neuropathological response involving all cell types in the brain. In the CNS, HIV-1 and its components initiate activation of chemokine receptors, inflammatory mediators and glutamate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity, all of which can activate numerous downstream signaling pathways and disturb neuronal and glial function. Recent experimental evidence suggests that disturbance by HIV-1 results not only in neuronal injury and death but also in impairment of neurogenesis. This article will review recently identified pathological mechanisms which potentially contribute to the development of neurocognitive impairment and dementia in association with HIV-1 infection.

AB Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most prominent cause of dementia in the elderly. To determine changes in the AD brain that may mediate the transition into dementia, the gene expression of approximately 10,000 full-length genes was compared in mild/moderate dementia cases to non-demented controls that exhibited high AD pathology. Including this latter group distinguishes this work from previous studies in that it allows analysis of early cognitive loss. Compared to non-demented high-pathology controls, the hippocampus of AD cases with mild/moderate dementia had increased gene expression of the inflammatory molecule major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, as assessed with microarray analysis. MHC II protein levels were also increased and inversely correlated with cognitive ability. Interestingly, the mild/moderate AD dementia cases also exhibited decreased number of T cells in the hippocampus and the cortex compared to controls. In conclusion, transition into AD dementia correlates with increased MHC II(+) microglia-mediated immunity and is paradoxically paralleled by a decrease in T cell number, suggesting immune dysfunction.

AB Recent findings implicating TRPM7 and TRPM2 in oxidative stress-induced neuronal death thrust these channels into the spotlight as possible therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we describe how the functional properties of TRPM7 and TRPM2 are interconnected with calcium (Ca(2+)) and magnesium (Mg(2+)) homeostasis, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immune mechanisms, all principal suspects in neurodegeneration. We focus our discussion on Western Pacific Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinsonism Dementia (PD) because extensive studies conducted over the years strongly suggest that these diseases are ideal candidates for a gene-environment model of etiology. The unique mineral environment identified in connection with Western Pacific ALS and PD, low Mg(2+) and Ca(2+), yet high in transition metals, creates a condition that could affect the proper function of these two channels.

AB The diagnostic potential of large A beta-peptide binding particles (LAPs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) patients and non-AD controls (nAD) was evaluated. LAPs were detected by confocal spectroscopy in both groups with high inter-individual variation in number. Molecular imaging by confocal microscopy revealed that LAPs are heterogeneous superaggregates that could be subdivided morphologically into four main types (LAP 1-4). LAP-4 type, resembling a 'large chain of pearls', was detected in 42.1% of all nAD controls but it was virtually absent in AD patients. LAP-4 type could be selectively removed by protein A beads, a clear indication that it contained immunoglobulins in addition to beta-amyloid peptides (A beta 1-42). We observed a close correlation between LAPs and immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration in CSF in controls but not in AD patients. Double labeling of LAPs with anti-A beta and anti-IgG antibodies confirmed that LAP-4 type consisted of A beta and IgG aggregates. Our results assign a central role to the immune system in regulating A beta1-42 homeostasis by clustering this peptide in immunocomplexes.

AB The objective of this study was to assess the role of interleukin-15 (IL-15) as a potential marker of immune reactions in patients with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The authors measured by immunoassay serum IL-15 levels in 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 15 patients with vascular dementia and compared them with serum IL-15 levels in 15 healthy subjects. The authors also studied the effect of treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) on serum IL-15 levels. Patients with Alzheimer's disease were found to have significantly lower serum IL-15 levels compared with healthy subjects and patients with vascular dementia. Healthy subjects and patients with vascular dementia did not differ between each other. Age, sex, disease duration, and Mini-Mental State Examination score did not affect IL-15 levels in any of the groups. Treatment with AChEI had no influence on IL-15 concentrations. The findings suggest that IL-15 is not implicated in the pathogenetic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. An immune hyporesponsiveness at some point during disease development may be responsible for the lower levels of IL-15 and other cytokines in Alzheimer's disease patients.

AB UNLABELLED: Interleukin-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine produced by activated blood monocytes, macrophages and glial cells. It enhances differentiation and proliferation of T cells and increases production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as Interferon-gamma and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha. There is little information about the involvement of IL-12 in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies.; OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to assess the role of IL-12 as a potential marker of immune reactions in patients with AD and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).; PATIENTS AND METHODS: We measured by immunoassay cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-12 levels in 19 patients with AD and 7 patients with FTD in comparison with CSF IL-12 levels in 30 patients with non-inflammatory neurological diseases served as neurological control patients (NCTRL). IL-12 levels were correlated with age, age of disease onset, disease duration, MMSE score, and rate of dementia progression. Abeta42 and Total tau (tau(T)) levels in CSF were also measured.; RESULTS: Patients with AD had significantly lower CSF IL-12 levels compared with NCTRL patients (p<0.001). Patients with FTD had also lower CSF IL-12 levels compared with NCTRL patients (p<0.05). Age, sex, disease duration and MMSE score did not affect IL-12 levels in any of the groups. In AD a significant positive correlation was noted between IL-12 levels and tau(T) levels (Rs=0.46, p=0.048).; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may suggest a reduced inflammatory reaction during the course of AD and FTD. A neurotrophic role of IL-12 and other proinflammatory cytokines cannot be excluded.

AB BACKGROUND: High serum vitamin B12 concentrations have been reported in patients with hepatic disease, disseminated neoplasia, myeloproliferative disorders, and hypereosinophilic syndromes. We recently discovered an extraordinarily increased vitamin B12 concentration in a patient without these underlying conditions.; METHODS: Affinity and size-exclusion chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and ELISA methods were used to determine the cause of the increased vitamin B12 concentrations in this patient's serum.; RESULTS: The protein G column eluates from 2 apparently healthy volunteers and 2 patients with recent vitamin B12 treatment for anemia had vitamin B12 concentrations of <74 pmol/L, whereas the vitamin B12 concentration in the protein G column eluate from the patient was 7380 pmol/L. The elution profile from size-exclusion chromatography of vitamin B12-binding proteins in the patient's serum revealed an abnormal vitamin-B12-binding protein. SDS-PAGE analysis of the concentrated eluates from the protein G column, under reducing conditions, revealed an additional band with an apparent molecular mass of 76 kDa, which was not present in control column eluates. MALDI-TOF MS identified this band as an IgM heavy chain. By use of a modified ELISA, we determined that the IgM present in the patient's eluates was associated with the IgG to form IgG-IgM immune complexes.; CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates the unusual circumstance of a patient with markedly increased vitamin B12 concentrations attributed to immune complexes composed of IgG, IgM, and vitamin B12 and illustrates techniques that can be used to identify this occurrence.

AB Inflammation and immune system activation seem to play an important role in the development and progression of dementia. Hyperhomocysteinemia is common in various forms of dementia, and a significant relationship was found between concentrations of homocysteine and immune activation marker neopterin. B vitamin supplementation is able to slow-down homocysteine formation in patients. In an open-label study, effects of B vitamin supplementation (Beneuran compositum ) on concentrations of homocysteine and neopterin were investigated in 58 patients with Alzheimer's disease (n=30), vascular dementia (n=12) and mild cognitive impairment (n=16). In all groups of patients, a significant percentage of patients presented with homocysteine concentrations >15 micromol/L and with elevated concentrations of immune activation marker neopterin. Decline of homocysteine concentrations was observed after one month of B vitamin supplementation (all p<0.01; paired Kruskal-Wallisn-test). By contrast, neopterin concentrations remained unchanged (all p>0.05). B vitamin supplementation in patients with various forms of dementia did not influence neopterin concentrations, which indicates that the degree of immune activation and inflammation remained unchanged. The question remains, if lowering of homocysteine by folate supplementation alone could have any beneficial effect to modulate the course of dementia development and if longer period of supplementation would also ameliorate immune system activation status.

AB Data on the serum level of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are scarce, although a specific biochemical marker easy to detect in body fluids is desired for an early diagnosis of disease and to monitor the effects of therapeutic treatment. In the current study, the content of AGEs was examined with an immunochemical assay in the sera of AD patients, in the frame of a search for a biochemical marker of disease. Subjects with AD and vascular dementia (VaD) were included in the study (n = 30; age range, 68-70 years). The results were compared to the healthy control groups. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) inhibition test for the determination of AGEs is based on a rabbit anti-AGE, affinity-purified antibody and a model AGE-myoglobin antigen, in which a serum sample treated with proteinase K is used as an inhibitor. For the measurement of immune complexes and anti-AGE antibodies, the corresponding ELISA tests have been applied. The AGE level in the VaD group (49.5 U(AGE)) was higher than in AD patients (46.1 U(AGE)). The level of total AGEs in the sera of AD patients was significantly lower than in the control group (50/51.6 U(AGE)). These relations were not observed with regard to the immune complexes and anti-AGE antibody levels in AD (70.2 U(IC)/0.027 U(IgG)) and VaD (83 U(IC)/0.034 U(IgG)) patients because the levels of these parameters were similar to the controls (76.2 U(IC)/0.042 U(IgG)). The work revealed the lower level of circulating serum AGEs in patients with AD in relation to healthy controls.

AB BACKGROUND: Pemphigoid is a form of auto-immune bullous dermatosis characterised by the production of antibodies directed against components of hemidesmosomes in the basal membrane. The physiopathological process responsible for unmasking of these antigens is unknown. Pemphigoid is more common in elderly subjects and is most often seen in debilitated subjects. The prevalence of pemphigoid anti-pemphigoid antibodies (anti-PB) is not known in the elderly population presenting no dermatological signs evocative of the disease. We studied the prevalence of anti-PBAg2 antibodies in elderly subjects with no signs of pemphigoid as well as in the correlation between the presence of these antibodies and diagnosis of dementia.; PATIENTS AND METHODS: Elderly subjects (aged over 69 years) with no signs of pemphigoid were recruited consecutively in dermatology and geriatrics departments (138 subjects). Details of concomitant medication were recorded for all subjects and clinical examination was performed with calculation of MMS (Mini Mental Score). The subjects were then divided into two groups based on MMS score. The first group comprised subjects without dementia (MMS > 24) while the second comprised subjects with dementia. Serum anti-PBAg2 antibodies were determined by ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence with confirmation by Western blot. Antinuclear antibodies, used as a control for non-specific immune response, were assayed in all serum samples. The prevalence of these antibodies was compared between the two groups.; RESULTS: The two groups were comparable in terms of age, sex and presence of dermatological diseases (ulcers, bedsores, erysipelas). Each group comprised 69 subjects. The overall presence of anti-PBAg2 antibodies in subjects with no signs are suggestive of pemphigoid was 3.6%. Presence of anti-PBAg2 antibodies was associated with diagnosis of dementia (p=0.04; 0% and 7% in groups 1 and 2, respectively). No correlation was seen between the presence of anti-PBAg2 antibodies and concomitant medication or dermatological disease. The overall prevalence of antinuclear antibodies was 14.5% and the figure was similar between the two groups.; DISCUSSION: The presence of anti-PBAg2 could be associated with the diagnosis of dementia in elderly subjects.

AB Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) has become a popular term designing all neurological and psychiatric complications in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It occurs in up to two thirds of all SLE patients and it covers a vast array of disorders ranging from peripheral neuropathy to stroke, psychosis, and dementia. Mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of NPSLE include anti-neuronal antibodies, antiphospholipid antibody associated thrombosis, emboli from cardiac source and, rarely, vasculitis by immune complex depositions. Although the most common manifestations is cognitive dysfunction (50%), NPSLE may also present itself as peripheral neuropathy (15%), psychosis (10%), or other central nervous system abnormalities (stroke, organic brain syndrome, seizures). In lupus patients, one should always look for secondary causes of the neuropsychiatric manifestation, including infection, toxic metabolic abnormalities, and hypertension. We present two cases of SLE, which developed neuropsychiatric manifestations.

AB Evidence from numerous neuropathological observations and in vivo clinical imaging studies suggests a prominent role of activated microglia, the main effector cell of the brain's innate immune system, in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Though the comprehensive molecular definition of the microglial activation process is still incomplete, the de novo expression of 'peripheral benzodiazepine-binding sites (PBBS)' by activated but not resting microglia has been established as a useful descriptor of functional state changes in microglia. As microglial transformation to an activated state is closely linked to progressive changes in brain disease, the detection of activated microglia can provide information about disease distribution and rate of disease progression. Positron emission tomography (PET) and [(11)C](R)-PK11195, a specific ligand of the PBBS, have been used to study systematically microglial activation in vivo. Significant microglial activation is present in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative dementia even at early and possibly preclinical stages of the disease with a spatial distribution reflecting different clinical phenotypes. We review some of the posited functions of activated microglia in the pathophysiology of dementia and speculate on the relationship between increased regional [(11)C](R)-PK11195 signals and the ensuing changes in brain volume. Finally, we provide a brief outlook on the development of new radioligands for the PBBS.

AB Epidemiological studies show that there is a correlation between chronic depression and the likelihood of dementia in later life. There is evidence that inflammatory changes in the brain are pathological features of both depression and dementia. This suggests that an increase in inflammation-induced apoptosis, together with a reduction in the synthesis of neurotrophic factors caused by a rise in brain glucocorticoids, may play a role in the pathology of these disorders. A reduction in the neuroprotective components of the kynurenine pathway such as kynurenic acid, and an increase in the neurodegenerative components, 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid, contribute to the pathological changes. Such changes are postulated to cause neuronal damage, and thereby predispose chronically depressed patients to dementia.

AB PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this article is to review the role of immunotherapy in the removal of proteins which accumulate abnormally in neurodegenerative disorders associated with dementia, in particular amyloid-beta accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.; RECENT FINDINGS: In both transgenic mouse models and in two trials of amyloid-beta immunotherapy for human Alzheimer's disease, active immunization with amyloid-beta 1-42 results in the removal of amyloid-beta plaques from the cerebral cortex associated with, in the mouse models, improvement in cognitive function. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy and neurofibrillary tangles persist, however, and there is also concern about T lymphocyte immune reactions in the meninges in the human cases. Active immunization schedules are being developed to minimize T lymphocyte reactions and to maximize antibody production and passive immunization protocols are being devised. Immunotherapy for removal of the proteins which accumulate in other neurodegenerative disorders associated with dementia such as prion proteins and alpha-synuclein are in the early stages of development.; SUMMARY: Dementias in the elderly are an increasing medical, social and economic problem and current treatments are only effective. In the majority of dementias, proteins accumulate within cells and in the extracellular compartments of the brain. In the most common dementia, Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-beta accumulates as plaques in the extracellular space of the grey matter and in artery walls as cerebral amyloid angiopathy and tau protein accumulates as neurofibrillary tangles within neurons.

AB Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL) is a recessively inherited disease characterized by early onset dementia associated with bone cysts. Our group has recently established the molecular background of PLOSL by identifying mutations in DAP12 and TREM2 genes. To understand how loss of function of the immune cell activating DAP12/TREM2 signaling complex leads to dementia and loss of myelin, we have analyzed here Dap12 and Trem2 expression in the mouse CNS. We show that Dap12 and Trem2 are expressed from embryonic stage to adulthood, and demonstrate a highly similar expression pattern. In addition, we identify microglial cells and oligodendrocytes as the major Dap12/Trem2-producing cells in the CNS and, consequently, as the predominant cell types involved in PLOSL pathogenesis. These findings provide a good starting point for the study of the molecular mechanisms of this inherited dementia and new evidence for the involvement of the immune system in neuronal degeneration.

AB Neuropsychiatric complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) may present clinically as acute or chronic organic brain syndrome, or mimic functional psychiatric diseases. Among such psychiatric diseases, mania tends to occur with increased frequency after the onset of AIDS. We report a case in which manic manifestations were noted before the diagnosis of AIDS. The patient had no past or family history of mood disorders, but had risk factors for HIV infection. He had a rapid downhill course from initial manic symptoms to depression, dementia and then death within 10 months. Such rapid cognitive deterioration into AIDS dementia after mania is consistent with previous reports. Cases like this will become more common with spread of the AIDS pandemic in Asian regions, including Taiwan. Clinicians should be mindful of HIV infection/AIDS as a differential diagnosis in patients with manic episodes and risk factors for HIV infection.

AB Published health benefits of regular light-to-moderate alcohol consumption include lower myocardial infarction rates, reduced heart failure rates, reduced risk of ischemic stroke, lower risk for dementia, decreased risk of diabetes and reduced risk of osteoporosis. Numerous complimentary biochemical changes have been identified that explain the beneficial effects of moderate alcohol consumption. Heavy alcohol consumption, however, can negatively affect neurologic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hematologic, immune, psychiatric and musculoskeletal organ systems. Binge drinking is a significant problem even among moderate drinkers and is associated with particularly high social and economic costs. A cautious approach should be emphasized for those individuals who drink even small amounts of alcohol. Physicians can apply the research evidence describing the known risks and benefits of alcohol consumption when counseling their patients regarding alcohol consumption.

AB Individuals expressing an APOE4 genotype demonstrate increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology and a decreased onset age. The APOE4 gene may act by modulating the CNS immune response. Using human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), we show a significantly greater increase in NO production during immune activation in MDM from APOE4 AD patients compared to normal, age-matched individuals or to AD patients with an APOE 3/3 genotype. Microglia and peritoneal macrophages from APOE4 targeted replacement mice demonstrate a similar increase in NO compared to the APOE3 targeted replacement mice. The enhanced macrophage responsiveness and the increased production of NO in APOE4 AD patients may predispose the CNS to an increased potential for nitration and nitrosation, consistent with the redox imbalance and neuroinflammatory state seen in AD.

AB BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines from the United States and Europe on the diagnosis and management of dementia include advice that younger patients with dementia should undergo CSF examination, which frequently includes analysis for oligoclonal bands (OCB). The presence of CNS specific OCB has traditionally been considered suggestive of an inflammatory aetiology, although the interpretation of such a finding in the presence of a normal CSF white cell count and protein is more difficult.; METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the prevalence of OCB, determined using agarose isoelectric focusing, in a series of 131 well characterised patients with a final diagnosis of a degenerative dementia who had undergone CSF examination.; RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 60.0 (SD 8.4) years. Seventy (53%) patients had Alzheimer's disease (AD), forty seven (36 %) had frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), seven (5%) had Dementia with Lewy bodies and the remaining seven (5%) patients had other rarer neurodegenerative dementias. Neuropathological examination had been performed in fifteen (11%) patients. CNS specific OCB were present in nine (7%) patients in this cohort, all of whom had normal CSF white cell counts: four AD patients (a prevalence of 6%), four FTLD patients (a prevalence of 9%), and one patient with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (a prevalence of 25%). Investigation of these patients, including two with neuropathologically verified AD and one with post-mortem confirmed CJD, did not reveal an alternative aetiology for their dementia.; CONCLUSION: A central immune response can occur in primary neurodegenerative dementias, albeit uncommonly.

AB Hyperhomocysteinemia is an established risk factor for atherosclerosis, thrombosis and other vascular diseases. Homocysteine auto-oxidation is considered to be crucially involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. However, the question remains to be elucidated whether vitamin deficiency and homocysteine accumulation are causal for disease development or rather comprise a secondary phenomenon. Most diseases accompanied by hyperhomocysteinemia are also associated with ongoing activation of the immune system. In vitro experiments show homocysteine to accumulate in stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In patients with coronary heart disease, with rheumatoid arthritis and in patients with dementia, an association between cellular immune activation and homocysteine metabolism is found. Homocysteine concentrations not only correlate inversely with folate concentrations, they also show a positive relationship with concentrations of immune activation markers like neopterin. Moreover, in patients with various kinds of dementia, increased concentrations of serum peroxides, homocysteine and neopterin correlate with each other. Studies support a role of immune system activation in the development of hyperhomocysteinemia. Stimulation and proliferation of immune cells may lead to the production of reactive oxygen species that may oxidize antioxidants and oxidation-sensitive B-vitamins. An enhanced demand for antioxidants as well as folate and vitamin B12 may develop, together with hyperhomocysteinemia, despite sufficient dietary intake.

AB OBJECTIVES: Recently an increase in serum neopterin has been described in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) that would be associated with an increased cell-mediated immune response. We have studied the serum levels of several monocyte/macrophage activation markers in patients with AD and other types of dementia.; DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum neopterin concentration, and the chitotriosidase (ChT), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) activities were determined in 30 patients with AD, in 19 patients with other types of dementia, and in 24 nonaffected controls.; RESULTS: Neopterin concentration was significantly higher in the subgroup of AD patients with a global deterioration scale higher than in the other patients with AD, patients with other types of dementia and in the control group (p < 0.005). However, the activities of ChT, ACE and ADA, despite having a significant correlation with neopterin, did not present any statistically significant differences among the groups studied.; CONCLUSION: In the most advanced clinical stages of AD, as well as an increased immune activation, an impaired formation of tetrahydrobiopterin from dehydroneopterin triphosphate would contribute to an increase in the serum concentration of neopterin. However, the large overlap between the groups, limits the possible clinical value of serum neopterin in AD patients.

AB Frontotemporal dementia is a term used to characterize diverse neuropathological conditions that can present with the same clinical phenotype. Five different neuropathologies underlie this disorder. However, consistent frontal and/or temporal neuronal loss and gliosis characterize all cases, the majority having no obvious pathological inclusions. Because neuronal loss and gliosis are consistent features across all cases, the present study aimed to determine the relationship between neuronal loss, gliosis and, for cases with abnormal tau inclusions, intracellular tau deposition. Formalin-fixed brain specimens from sporadic cases with frontotemporal dementia (eight with tau-positive Pick bodies, five with frontotemporal lobar degeneration without inclusions) were compared with those from non-diseased controls (n = 5). Brain specimens were cut into 3 mm coronal slices for evaluation and tissue samples from the superior frontal gyrus were taken for microscopic analysis. Immuno histochemistry for glia-specific proteins (astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein and microglial major histocompatibility complex II) and different tau epitopes was performed on 50 microm free-floating sections. Gross patterns of brain atrophy were analysed and upper and lower layer pyramidal neurons and glial cell numbers were quantified. A disease severity scheme was devised using the degree of gross macroscopic frontal and temporal atrophy to establish the relationship between the gliosis and neurodegeneration. In this small sample, the patterns of gross atrophy could be grouped reliably into four stages of severity. These stages were the same across disease groups and correlated with volume- corrected pyramidal neuron densities. In cases with Pick bodies, disease stage also correlated with duration, providing further evidence that these stages represent the progression of degeneration in this limited sample. Whereas there were, on average, many more reactive astrocytes in the cases with Pick bodies than in those with frontotemporal lobar atrophy, there was significant overlap between cases in the degree of astrocytosis. However, a large proportion of the astrocytes in Pick's disease displayed phosphorylated tau immunoreactivity, whereas no tau-positive astrocytes were found in frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The pattern and degree of microglia activation were similar in all the dementia cases analysed, with considerably more activated microglia accumulating in white matter. In this small sample, the abundance of white matter microglia at early disease stages suggests a prominent role for this cell type in the neurodegenerative process. In frontotemporal lobar degeneration, a significant proportion of the activated white matter microglia were tau-2-immunoreactive, suggesting direct involvement in axonal degeneration, possibly via immune processes.

AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain and the most frequent cause of dementia among elderly. The etiology of AD is still obscure, but genetic and environmental factors appear to play differential roles in the disease. Several evidence suggest that inflammation or altered immune responses may play an important role in this disease. The following topics will be discussed: (1) the association of inflammation with brain degenerative processes in AD; (2) the influence of cytokine gene polymorphism upon the risk of developing AD and/or the age at onset of manifestation clinical dementia; (3) the effects of gene allele variations upon the phenotype of immune molecules in the blood and brain of AD patients; (4) the association of genetic variations in some of this molecules with the progression of the disease and cognitive decline.

AB In this review, topics with scientific strength, topical interest, and controversy were selected. Over the past 50 years, malnutrition has become increasingly recognized as a cause of increased morbidity and mortality in hospital patients. From 1970 to 1980, parenteral nutrition was advocated as the most appropriate form of nutritional therapy for hospital patients. Since then, parenteral nutrition has been replaced by enteral nutrition as the best way of delivering nutrients to hospital patients. The timing of enteral nutrition has been debated. Should it be instituted early, within the first 24 hours? In addition, enteral nutrition containing immune-enhancing nutrients such as arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, glutamine, and nucleotides has been advocated for critically ill patients. The relative merits of enteral versus total parenteral nutrition continue to be debated. Questions about possible complications related to enteral nutrition have been raised. Patients are at risk of nosocomial pneumonia from aspiration and at risk of bowel ischemia because enteral nutrition increases intestinal oxygen consumption. Steroids are often used to treat Crohn disease, but because of undesirable side effects, various techniques have been used to reduce steroid dependency. Enteral nutrition has been advocated as a way of reducing steroid dependency. Finally, enteral nutrition is routinely used to feed demented patients and those in a vegetative state. It is not clear whether this practice alters outcome or quality of life.

AB Average life expectancy throughout developed countries has rapidly increased during the latter half of the 20th century and geriatric infectious diseases have become an increasingly important issue. Infections in the elderly are not only more frequent and more severe, but they also have distinct features with respect to clinical presentation, laboratory results, microbial epidemiology, treatment, and infection control. Reasons for increased susceptibility include epidemiological elements, immunosenescence, and malnutrition, as well as a large number of age-associated physiological and anatomical alterations. Moreover, ageing may be the cause of infection but infection can also be the cause of ageing. Mechanisms may include enhanced inflammation, pathogen-dependent tissue destruction, or accelerated cellular ageing through increased turnover. In most instances, treatment of infection leads to a satisfactory outcome in the elderly. However, in palliative care situations and in patients with terminal dementia, the decision whether or not to treat an infectious disease is becoming a difficult ethical issue.

AB Providing care to a family member with dementia is conceptualized as a chronic stressor with adverse psychological and physical effects. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate mood and immune outcomes of caregivers exposed to a community-based psychoeducational nursing intervention based on the progressively lowered stress threshold (PLST) model. The PLST intervention is designed to strengthen the psychological resources of dementia caregivers by teaching methods of preventing and/or managing behavioral problems exhibited by the person with dementia. Mood and immune outcomes were compared between caregivers randomly assigned to receive either the PLST or a comparison intervention. Results of this pilot study suggest that caregivers who received the PLST intervention showed significantly stronger T-cell proliferative responses to both PHA and ConA, indicating an improvement in T-cell immune function immediately after the in-home intervention (T2) and again after 6 months of telephone support for application of the PLST model (T3). Findings do not support the hypothesis that the PLST intervention had a significant effect on total mood disturbance or natural killer cell cytotoxicity over the course of the study.

AB BACKGROUND: Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, are diseases characterized by progressive deterioration in the central nervous system with neuronal degeneration, vacuolatization of the neuropil, and gliosis. Little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms of infection, and controversy exits around the inciting infective agent. It has been shown that an important factor in pathogenesis is the immune system.; CASE: The reported case points to beneficial effects when antioxidant therapies are used in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The case revealed an early reversal in cognitive decline and subsequent improvements in myoclonus, apnea and rigidity. Although death was the ultimate outcome, the patient succumbed to the illness over 22 months after the onset of symptoms when the early rapid decline predicted demise within a few months.; CONCLUSION: It is possible that strategies blocking the effect of proinflammatory cytokines and the resulting oxidative damage may stem the progressive damage to the neuropil that occurs in spongiform encephalopathies. Further investigation into the use of antioxidants and other types of agents quelling inflammation needs to be undertaken. If antioxidants could be combined with treatments for the inciting infective agent, a new direction could be taken in the outcome of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies including CJD and vCJD.

AB Evidence indicates that the actions of nerve growth factor (NGF) reach beyond the nervous system and might modulate immune function. Based on reports that blood NGF rises following the acute stress of parachute jumping, we investigated whether exposure to a chronic stressor, caregiving for a cognitively impaired spouse, could alter the levels of blood NGF. High perceived stress and depression in caregivers (vs. well-matched controls) were associated with elevated blood NGF. These data suggest that exposure to this chronic stressor can alter the concentrations of circulating NGF, and that psychological stress can induce changes in NGF concentrations in older adults.

AB Diffuse neurofibrillary tangles with calcification (DNTC) is an atypical dementia and is characterized pathologically by diffuse neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) without senile plaques (SPs). In this study, we investigated the distribution of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR-positive activated microglia in postmortem brain tissue of six patients with DNTC and six patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). HLA-DR-positive activated microglia were observed to associate with SPs in AD. In the DNTC brain, which lacks SPs, HLA-DR-positive microglia were mainly accumulated around weakly tau-positive NFTs, which were also positive for anti-amyloid-P and anti-C3d antibodies. The results of this study suggest that the complement pathway is also activated in the DNTC brain and that immune and inflammatory responses, including microglia activation, may occur around extracellular NFTs in DNTC patients.

AB The health of informal caregivers is often studied from the perspective of caregivers' and care receivers' personal and interpersonal characteristics. This study offers an alternative explanation based on a vulnerable populations framework and considers the role of resource availability to the health status of informal caregivers (n=76). Caregivers in a convenience sample were females of diverse ethnicity and socioeconomic status, and care recipients were diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) or age-related dementias (ARD). Personal interviews using structured instruments were conducted with caregivers who were attending outpatient clinics at a public hospital and a VA hospital. Instruments included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression-Scale (CES-D), the Global Health Assessment (GHA), the Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADL), the Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist (MBPC) and items from the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) measuring anger, anxiety and loneliness. Caregivers were experiencing both physical and mental health problems. Regression analyses were used to examine the relationships among resources available to caregivers, conditions that put caregivers at risk for poorer health, and health status itself. Analyses were conducted for each group of caregivers separately (HIV and ARD) and for the total group, using depressive symptoms and perception of physical health as dependent variables. In caregivers of people with HIV/AIDS (PWHIV), caregiver distress over care recipient symptoms, anxiety and education were related to depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms, anger and functional status of the PWHIV were related to caregivers' perception of poorer physical health. In caregivers of people with ARD, there were no significant predictors for depressive symptoms or perception of physical health. In the total group of caregivers, lower income and more anger were related to depressive symptom score. When perception of physical health was the dependent variable, minority ethnicity and depressive mood were related to worse perception of physical health. These findings support the relationship of a lack of resources to health status. A community-based programme of resources and health care services for the caregiver-care receiver dyad is recommended.

AB Caring for the chronically ill is associated with chronic distress. In view of the adverse effects of distress on cellular immune function, such distress may have implications for health. Indeed, it has been proposed that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a potential psychobiological mediator of these effects. In this study, we observed that elderly caregivers experienced greater distress and increased salivary cortisol than non-caregivers. In addition, caregivers had blunted mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, lower mitogen-induced IL-2 production, and reduced lymphocyte sensitivity to glucocorticoids. These results indicate that chronic distress is associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity which is, in turn, associated with elevated basal steroid levels and altered steroid immunoregulation at the level of the lymphocyte.

AB Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLAb) may cause both focal ischemic and diffuse brain damage and may be associated with dementia. We have examined the relationship of aPLAb to dementia in the elderly. Blood samples were obtained from 87 consecutive patients with dementia (74 +/- 11 years old) and 69 controls (78 +/- 9 years old), residents of an old age home who were not overtly demented. Levels of aPLAb were measured by a standardized ELISA, utilizing cardiolipin as antigen, and we considered levels above 20 IgG antiphospholipid units (GPLU) as significantly elevated. We found that 5 of the 87 demented patients (6%), but none of the 69 controls, had significantly elevated aPLAb levels (p = 0.03, one-tailed Fisher's exact test). All the patients with high aPLAb levels were diagnosed clinically as having dementia of the Alzheimer type, except for 1 who had mixed dementia, and none had features of an immune-mediated disease. Thus, a small but significant number of patients with dementia have high levels of aPLAb. The role of the aPLAb in these patients, with apparently diffuse brain disease, is currently unknown.

AB BACKGROUND: There are many reports of psychological morbidity in spousal carers of patients with dementia. The consequences of this increased stress on the immune system are unclear. We investigated whether antibody responses to influenza vaccination differed between carers and a control group, and the relation of the antibody response to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.; METHODS: 50 spousal carers of dementia patients, median age 73 years (IQR 66-77), and 67 controls (68 years [66-71]) of similar socioeconomic status were enrolled. Anxiety and depression were measured by the Savage Aged Personality Screening Scale and stress by the Global Measure of Perceived Stress scale. Principal-component analysis was used to yield a summary score of emotional distress from these two scales. Salivary cortisol concentrations were measured over a single day at three times (0800-1000, 1100-1300, and 2000-2200). Participants received a trivalent influenza vaccine and IgG antibody titres to each strain were measured on days 0, 7, 14, and 28.; FINDINGS: Mean scores of emotional distress were significantly higher in carers at each time point than in controls (all p<0.0003). Mean (SD) salivary cortisol concentrations, calculated as area under the curve (AUC), were higher in carers than controls at all three assessments (6 months 16.0 [8.0] vs 11.2 [4.4], p=0.0001; respectively). Eight (16%) of 50 carers and 26 (39%) of 67 controls had a four-fold increase in at least one of the IgG titres (p=0.007). There was an inverse relation between AUC cortisol and IgG antibody titre to the Nanchang strain that was significant on day 14 (r=-0.216, p=0.039).; INTERPRETATION: Elderly carers of spouses with dementia have increased activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and a poor antibody response to influenza vaccine. Carers may be more vulnerable to infectious disease than the population of a similar age.

AB Similar to the setting of other chronic, debilitating diseases, considerable psychoeducational support of the patient's family and other caregivers represents an often-overlooked component of appropriately thorough care. Nearly three of four persons caring for an individual with PD report psychological stress and anxiety, which are exacerbated by concerns about progression of the disease. Counseling for PD caregivers can be dispensed particularly effectively through individual psychological counseling as well as PD support and community self-help groups that assist caregivers in sharing concerns and promote a sense they are understood by others. Through such measures, which may be delivered effectively by nurse practitioners, PD caregivers can develop effective coping strategies for disease related stressors. Empirical results show the most common stressors are: anxiety, concern about the future, impatience or intolerance, loss of autonomy, sleep disturbances, diminished time and opportunity for recreation and social contact, and anger. These sequelae often ensue when the PD patient evidences depression, advanced dementia, or psychosis, each of which can severely constrain communication. Caregivers often must also contend with two other adverse psychological phenomena: cognitive dissonance surrounding placement of the patient in a nursing home and learned helplessness, which may predispose to depressive states. Other often unmet needs of the "hidden victims" of PD include compromised immune function, social stigmata, and financial difficulties. Respite care may be useful in reducing the stress associated with these and other problems frequently affecting caregivers.

AB Paraneoplastic opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia (POMA) is a neurologic disorder thought to be mediated by an autoimmune attack against onconeural disease antigens that are expressed by gynecologic or lung tumors and by neurons. One POMA disease antigen, termed Nova-1, has been identified as a neuron-specific KH-type RNA-binding protein. Nova-1 expression is restricted to specific regions of the central nervous system, primarily the hindbrain and ventral spinal cord, which correlate with the predominantly motor symptoms in POMA. However, POMA antisera recognize antigens that are widely expressed in both caudal and rostral regions of the central nervous system, and some patients develop cognitive symptoms. We have used POMA antisera to clone a cDNA encoding a second POMA disease antigen termed Nova-2. Nova-2 is closely related to Nova-1, and is expressed at high levels in neurons during development and in adulthood, and at lower levels in the adult lung. In the postnatal mouse brain, Nova-2 is expressed in a pattern that is largely reciprocal with Nova-1, including high levels of Nova-2 expression in the neocortex and hippocampus. Functional characterization of Nova-2 in RNA selection and nitrocellulose filter-binding assays reveals that Nova-2 binds RNA with high affinity and with sequence specificity that differs from Nova-1. Our results demonstrate that the immune response in POMA targets a family of highly related sequence-specific neuronal RNA-binding proteins. The expression pattern of the Nova-2 protein is likely to underlie the development of cognitive deficits in some POMA patients.

AB INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory processes are suspected in the pathomechanism of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) but the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of inflammatory cytokines are not yet determined in the different forms of the disorder.; SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were examined in the sera and CSF of patients with mild-moderate and severe stage of late onset sporadic type of AD and in the sera of demented Down syndrome (DS) probands with similar stages of AD and compared with data of age-matched healthy controls.; RESULTS: Normal serum IL-6 levels were found in the mild-moderate stage, but significantly increased levels were found in the severe stage of both dementia groups. The CSF concentrations remained within the normal range in all groups. Positive correlations between the serum IL-6 levels and age and the severity of the disease were present.; CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a disease stage dependent general activation of the immune system both in sporadic AD and in DS with AD.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether vaccination against hepatitis B may be omitted in persons with isolated positive anti-HBc.; DESIGN: Prospective study using control groups. SETTING'S: Heeren Loo-Lozenoord, Ermelo, the Netherlands.; METHOD: Twenty-six older residents (group P) with isolated anti-HBc positivity (HBsAg negative and anti-HBs < 10 IU/l) were given hepatitis B vaccine (3 doses); 16 matched controls (group C1) lacking hepatitis B markers, received a primary vaccination (3 doses), 8 controls (group C2) with a immune status based on infection in the past received vaccination (3 doses) and 27 controls (group C3) were given a booster vaccination (1 dose) after vaccination 7 years earlier. The anti-HBs response was measured 0, 1 and 7 months after the first vaccine dose. An anamnestic response was defined as a fourfold rise of anti-HBs after one dose of vaccine or--in the absence of an anti-HBs titer in the prevaccination serum--a response > or = 10 IU/l after one dose of vaccine. A primary response was defined as an anti-HBs response > or = 10 IU/l after giving 3 vaccines, while the criteria for an anamnestic response were not met.; RESULTS: In the isolated anti-HBc group (P) and in the corresponding control group (C2) 15 and 12.5%, respectively, showed an anamnestic response; the majority reacted with a primary response or did not respond at all. The subjects given a primary vaccination (C1) responded in 62.5% with a primary response while those vaccinated earlier (C3) responded in 92.6% with a fourfold rise of anti-HBs.; CONCLUSIONS: The anti-HBs response to vaccination in older mentally handicapped persons is delayed and there is a reduced chance of development of a protective anti-HBs titer. The majority of individuals with isolated anti-HBc showed a primary response. In these persons vaccination should not be omitted, especially if there is a risk of hepatitis B.

AB Blood cells, especially platelets and lymphocytes, are used in neuropsychiatric research as tools for investigating systemic derangements in neuropsychiatric disorders, and as peripheral models for studying central nervous system biochemistry. In the present work, we determined T lymphocyte peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding: a significant reduction of Bmax values was observed in demented patients as compared with healthy controls, whereas Kd values were similar in the two subjects' groups. A significant negative correlation was found between Bmax values and illness severity. These data, which seem to be related to an impairment of immune response and cell energy metabolism in demented patients, may represent a state-dependent marker in monitoring disease course and treatment efficacy.

AB We compared 71 family caregivers of dementia sufferers and 58 control subjects on three different immune measures relevant to latent herpes simplex virus Type 1 (HSV-1) infection: neutralizing antibody titers, antibody titers to a total viral antigen, and a proliferative memory T-cell response. Caregivers had significantly higher antibody titers to the total viral antigen and a poorer HSV-1 specific T-cell response than controls, but no significant difference in neutralizing antibody titers between groups was observed. These data provide additional evidence that psychological stress can modulate a virus-specific immune response associated with caregiving.

AB The case of a 6-year-old boy who developed childhood disintegrative disorder (Heller syndrome) at the age of 4 years is presented, and specifics of the neurologic evaluation are detailed. A table is provided suggesting the complete neurologic work-up with the potential findings for children presenting with signs and symptoms of deterioration. A hypothesis for the aetiology of Heller syndrome proposes that predisposing genetic factors when combined with an environmental stress result in the deposition of amyloid and the disruption of synaptic transmission during the deterioration period. Speculation that the deterioration may be self-limited by activation of an immune response is based upon earlier findings that interleukin 1 has been shown to be involved in the breakdown of amyloid precursor protein in humans.

AB To determine whether a chronic stressor (caregiving for a spouse with a progressive dementia) is associated with an impaired immune response to influenza virus vaccination, we compared 32 caregivers' vaccine responses with those of 32 sex-, age-, and socioeconomically matched control subjects. Caregivers showed a poorer antibody response following vaccination relative to control subjects as assessed by two independent methods, ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition. Caregivers also had lower levels of in vitro virus-specific-induced interleukin 2 levels and interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6 did not differ between groups. These data demonstrate that down-regulation of the immune response to influenza virus vaccination is associated with a chronic stressor in the elderly. These results could have implications for vulnerability to infection among older adults.

AB Alzheimer disease, Pick disease and senile dementia are all characterized by similar morphological changes, both macroscopic and microscopic, and similar psychiatric symptoms. All three should, therefore, be viewed as aspects of one disease, which is termed Alzheimer-type dementia. Nothing contradicts the view that immune complexes take part in the etiology of Alzheimer-type dementia. There are various types of immune complexes and so their points of action in the organism may vary. There might be two main means of preventing Alzheimer-type dementia: the first could be named the serological (basic) and the second relying on pharmacotherapy (additional). Pharmacological prevention of disease might be aided by the use of parasympathomimetic drugs, e.g. pilocarpine.

AB Relationships between neurophysiological and immune parameters were studied in normal middle-aged and elderly subjects and in patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT). The rate of such interaction was minimal in normal aging, in DAT neuroimmune relations increased. The correlation between the immune parameters and the characteristics of components of visual evoked potentials and auditory brain-stem responses suggests that in the middle-aged healthy subjects, a primary role in neuroimmune relations belongs to limbicoreticular structures and to the mesencephalon. In normal aging, the influence of limbicoreticular structures on immune structures decreases. In DAT, the modulation of immune processes by limbicoreticular and thalamocortical structures, as well as the pontobulbar part of the brain stem increases. In middle age and in DAT, persons with different functional brain asymmetry (as estimated from electrophysiological criteria) have different lymphocytic functional activities and rates of neuroimmune interactions.

AB This is the report of a case of a 41-year-old male patient with a rapidly progressing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) combined with a severe presenile dementia. Screening for antibody binding on fresh-frozen human brain sections, we found that the patient's cerebrospinal fluid contained antibodies against microglia, the dominant and potentially cytotoxic immuneffector cell of the brain. This finding extends previous observations of CSF autoantibodies against microglia in neurodegenerative diseases. It demonstrates that in addition to antigens of neuronal origin (e.g. anti-Purkinje cell antibodies in paraneoplastic cerebellar dysfunction), glial antigens also appear to be under the surveillance of the CNS and/or the peripheral immune system. Our data provide evidence for a close link between neurodegeneration and the activation of microglia; a possible local antigen production against microglia/brain macrophages, which might regulate the concomitant glial activation in neurodegenerative diseases; and the presence of microglia-binding cerebrospinal antibodies as a marker for the acuity of the disease process underlying the acute deterioration of the neurological and cognitive performance in patients with, e.g., ALS. Future therapeutic strategies could therefore include the modulation of the possibly disease-promoting activation of microglia/brain macrophages.

AB BACKGROUND: Until recently, new data on immune aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have suggested that some facets of AD pathogenesis may be immune related. However, the effects of dementia itself on immune function have not been considered.; AIM: To compare the distribution of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and their function in patients with AD and other dementias.; METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocyte numbers, T cell subset distribution, proliferative responses to mitogens and suppressor cell assay were studied in a well characterised group of patients with AD, and compared to patients with other forms of dementia. Age and sex matched elderly controls were screened to exclude dementia, and young controls were medical, paramedical and laboratory staff. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and student's test were used for statistical analysis.; RESULTS: The CD8+ lymphocyte population was reduced in AD and in other forms of dementia, when compared with non-demented elderly and young controls. Concanavalin A induced lymphocyte transformation was reduced in all dementia groups and in elderly compared with young controls. The changes in T cell numbers and function were not specific for Alzheimer's disease, but were found also in other forms of dementia.

AB Progressive supranuclear palsy is neuropathologically characterized by neuronal degeneration of the basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum. In addition, cortical neuronal degeneration associated with neurofibrillary tangles formation has been identified over wide areas of the brain in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. We studied the distribution of alpha B-crystallin-positive degenerating neurons in cases with progressive supranuclear palsy, and compared them with those in Pick's disease. Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia of Alzheimer type, and normal aged individuals. A large number of alpha B-crystallin-positive neurons was found in the cerebral cortices of four out of nine patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. In particular, alpha B-crystallin-positive ballooned neurons were frequently observed in deep cortical pyramidal cell layers of the limbic and paralimbic systems in these diseases. The involvement of the limbic and paralimbic systems may thus contribute to personality changes as well as to memory and cognitive impairment in some patients with progressive supranuclear palsy.

AB Neurofibrillary tangles are observed in several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam. The major components of neurofibrillary tangles are hyperphosphorylated tau proteins that can be directly detected in brain homogenates, using immunoblotting with specific immunological probes. To investigate whether tau proteins differ biochemically among various neurodegenerative disorders, we analyzed a series of brain samples from Guamanian patients in comparison with Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and normal aging. In Alzheimer's disease, these hyperphosphorylated tau proteins are composed of a triplet referred to as tau 55, 64, and 69, whereas in progressive supranuclear palsy, neurofibrillary degeneration is characterized by a tau doublet (tau 64 and 69). In the present study, characterization of tau proteins was performed by immunoblotting, on different cortical and subcortical regions of postmortem brain specimens from Guamanian natives. In all of the cases, biochemical data were always consistent with neuropathological findings. In contrast to Alzheimer's disease patients where the tau triplet is found mostly in cortical regions, a similar triplet was strongly detected in both cortical and subcortical areas in Guamanian patients. The tau profile differed quantitatively from case to case demonstrating that the Alzheimer's disease-related tau triplet had a heterogeneous regional distribution. These data suggest that the tau triplet found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam is similar to that observed in Alzheimer's disease, and the regional distribution of tau proteins differs in these disorders.

AB The potential clinical utility of SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) brain imaging to clarifying certain diagnostic dilemmas faced by clinical psychiatrists is considered generally and is illustrated by several case vignettes. Three case histories consider dementia vs depressive pseudodementia, two the possibility of a cerebral vasculitis in patients with auto-immune conditions, and two whether the patient had a "type" of depression likely to benefit from a course of ECT. Published studies reviewing the utility of SPECT in dementia, depression, depressive "pseudodementia" and cerebral lupus are considered. It is suggested that SPECT is an important investigatory technique providing additional information that may assist some diagnostic decisions, while its utility in assisting other clinical decisions awaits clarification.

AB Experimental autoimmune dementia (EAD) is a rat model designed to examine the potential role of anti-cholinergic neurons antibodies (Abs) in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. We have previously shown that sera of AD and Down's syndrome patients contain Abs which bind specifically to the high molecular weight neurofilament protein (NF-H) of the purely cholinergic electromotor neurons of Torpedo. Production of such Abs in EAD rats by prolonged immunization with Torpedo cholinergic NF-H results in the accumulation of IgG in the septum and hippocampus of the immunized rats and in memory deficits. In the present study, we examined immunohistochemically whether the anti-cholinergic NF-H immune response of the EAD rats affects their brain cholinergic neurons. In addition, since dementia is associated with severe deterioration in the spatio-temporal organization of behavior, we examined whether EAD rats also mimic this important feature of dementia. The results obtained show that production in EAD rats of anti-cholinergic NF-H Abs similar to those found in AD patients results in a marked decrease in the density of forebrain cholinergic neurons and in derangements in the spatio-temporal organization of their behavior. These findings may replicate pathogenic processes in AD and support a role for anti-cholinergic NF-H Abs in the degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the disease.

AB Vertebrates carry large numbers of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and related sequences in their genomes. These retroviral elements are inherited as Mendelian traits. Generally, ERVs are defective without the ability of being expressed as viral particles. However, ERV sequences often have a potential for expression of at least some proteins. So far, the possible biological significance of ERVs is not clear. Nonetheless, there are observations suggesting a connection between ERVs and various diseases. This is the case with murine lupus and a spinal cord disease of certain mouse strains. In the present review, we discuss possible mechanisms by which ERVs could contribute to the development of human degenerative and inflammatory nervous system diseases, including direct effects on nervous system cells and immune cells. Interactions between ERVs and infectious viruses are also discussed. Finally, we review a possible retroviral etiology of multiple sclerosis.

AB Sera of Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome patients contain antibodies which bind specifically to the high molecular weight neurofilament protein of Torpedo cholinergic neurons. We have recently shown that prolonged immunization of rats with this antigen results in the accumulation of IgG in neurons in the septum and hippocampus of the immunized rats and in cognitive impairments. This animal model is termed experimental autoimmune dementia. In the present study we examined whether the anti-cholinergic high molecular weight neurofilament subunit immune response of the experimental autoimmune dementia rats affects forebrain cholinergic neurons. This was performed immunohistochemically utilizing a monoclonal antibody to nerve growth factor receptor, a specific marker of cholinergic neurons in the forebrain. The results obtained revealed significant decreases in the density of cholinergic neurons in the medial septal nucleus and diagonal band of the experimental autoimmune dementia rats. These decreases are specific to the anti-cholinergic high molecular weight neurofilament subunit immune response of the experimental autoimmune dementia rats and are not observed in control rats which were immunized with chemically heterogeneous high molecular weight neurofilament subunit. The decrease in density of forebrain cholinergic neurons in experimental autoimmune dementia rats may mimic pathogenic processes in Alzheimer's disease and supports a role for anti-cholinergic high molecular weight neurofilament subunit antibodies in the degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the disease.

In the present study we characterized the open-field behavior of experimental autoimmune dementia rats, and examined whether, like in dementia, the spatiotemporal organization of their behavior is impaired. The results obtained revealed that experimental autoimmune dementia rats travel shorter distances; explore a smaller part of the open-field; and perform less round-trips to the key location--the home base--in reference to which their behavior is normally organized. The shrinkage of the explored space and the reduced number of round trips are independent of the amount of locomotion and represent a deterioration in the organization of behavior in time and space. These behavioral changes are specific to the anti-cholinergic immune response of experimental autoimmune dementia rats as they are not observed in rats which were immunized with chemically heterogeneous high molecular weight neurofilament subunit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB The development of strategies for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other age-associated dementias is an important goal of research in the neurosciences. It is suggested that advances in understanding of the etiology of those disorders would provide the most obvious avenues to development of preventative treatments. Research findings from both clinical investigations and studies of animal models are presented which suggest a neuroimmunologic component in age-associated dementia. Clinical studies suggest an association between dementia and brain-reactive autoantibodies in subsets of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Studies of mice suggest that: 1) when compared with normal genotypes, mutant mice with accelerated autoimmunity show learning and memory impairments at earlier chronological ages; 2) the learning and memory deficits of autoimmune and normal mice are qualitatively similar; 3) the behavioral deficits of normal aged and autoimmune mice are sensitive to similar pharmacologic interventions. Overall, these findings suggest that intervention strategies targeting the immune system might be useful in the treatment or prevention of aging-associated dementia. Autoimmune mice would be useful as models for the development and testing of such immune-based interventions.

AB We studied the brains of three patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), all of whom developed subacutely progressive dementia unassociated with opportunistic infection or neoplasm in the central nervous system. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the head revealed cortical atrophy, ventricular dilation, and diffuse hypodensity of the centrum semiovale. On microscopic examination, the cerebral and cerebellar white matter in all cases showed diffuse and focal, angiocentric regions of myelin pallor, focal vacuolization, and extensive gliosis. Variable axonal loss and axonal spheroids were evident. The microvasculature showed striking changes, including mural thickening, increased cellularity, and enlargement and pleomorphism of endothelial cells with variable numbers of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells (MNGC), which often contained hemosiderin pigment. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antigens were identified immunocytochemically within perivascular macrophages and MNGC and in some microglial cells. We suggest that the morphologic abnormalities of the microcirculation may be associated with an alteration of the blood-brain barrier. The increased vascular permeability could contribute to damage and loss of the white matter including both myelin and axons, and result in subcortical cerebral atrophy. The HIV-1 infected cells present in relation to the microvasculature may play a role in mediating the vascular injury.

AB We investigated serum neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine concentrations in 23 HIV-1 seropositive patients (Walter Reed Stage 4-6). Ten patients presented with polyneuropathy and three with dementia, one of the patients with dementia also had polyneuropathy and dementia. We found significant associations between lower trytophan concentrations and neurologic/psychiatric symptoms. The negative correlation of tryptophan with kynurenine and neopterin concentrations indicates activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in patients. IDO can be induced by cytokines such as interferon-gamma and therefore low tryptophan levels may result from chronic immune stimulation in HIV-1 seropositives.

AB Cytokines play an important role not only for initiation of immune reactivity but also for development of tissue injury. Of 38 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 22 (58%) and 16 (42%) patients, respectively. Among the IL-1 beta- and IL-6-positive CSF were eight of 15 HIV-1 patients with no clinical signs of central nervous system involvement and four of five patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex. The presence of IL-6 was often associated with IL-1 beta and soluble interleukin-2 receptor in CSF as well as with intrathecal IgG synthesis. In none of the CSF samples tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-2 was detected.

The highest concentrations occurred in those with lymphoma, neurologic opportunistic infections, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome dementia complex (ADC). There was a high correlation between the CSF beta 2M concentration and ADC severity, suggesting that CSF beta 2M may be useful as a marker for the development, progression, and perhaps response to treatment of ADC. Elevated CSF beta 2M was not due to CSF pleocytosis and was usually independent of blood-brain barrier dysfunction.

AB Neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-M) concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood were measured in 56 individuals in various stages of HIV-1 infection. Elevated levels of neopterin as well as beta 2-M were found in the CSF of three patients with primary HIV-1 infection and also in subjects in the early stages of chronic HIV-1 infection, with the highest levels in HIV-1 isolation-positive people. There was a clear correlation between the concentrations of the two substances and the levels seemed to increase in parallel with progress of infection. A similar pattern was found in blood. Higher concentrations of neopterin and beta 2-M in CSF than in blood were found in patients with advanced dementia in particular. These findings indicate that the cellular immune system in the central nervous system (CNS) may be activated during the early stages of HIV-1 infection without concomitant overt neurological symptoms. The pathological processes in CNS and blood seem to develop in parallel rather than being restricted to one compartment.

AB Neopterin, a biochemical marker for the activation of cell-mediated immune reactions, was determined in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients infected with HIV-1. A significant correlation was found between serum and CSF neopterin concentrations, although concentrations of neopterin in serum were more closely correlated with the clinical severity of HIV-1 infection than those in CSF. However, higher CSF levels were observed in patients with neurologic/psychiatric symptoms than in unaffected patients. Also, quotients of CSF neopterin versus serum neopterin concentrations were increased, indicating intrathecal production of neopterin. Positive HIV-1 isolation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was associated with higher neopterin concentrations in serum, when compared with negative HIV-1 isolation. Neopterin in CSF appears to be a suitable biochemical marker in patients with HIV-1 infection for detecting overt neurologic/psychiatric disturbances. The data suggest that in HIV-1 infected patients, cell-mediated immune reactions might be activated intrathecally and might contribute to neuropsychiatric disease.

AB Slow virus diseases are characterized by a long asymptomatic period, often months or years in duration, between the introduction of the infectious agent and the appearance of clinical illness. Two distinct groups cause serious degenerative diseases of the brain and spinal cord. The first to be identified are those caused by "unconventional agents," kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The second category, "conventional virus diseases," include SSPE (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis), PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), progressive rubella encephalitis, and HIV encephalopathy. The universal focus on acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has stimulated new research on slow viruses. The extreme neurological deficits, the chronic nature of these diseases, and the possible concern with infection control make patients with these diseases a challenge to nursing.

AB The paper describes the psychiatric status on the basis of 76 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. There is considerable difference between the different stages of the disease. The disorders are divided into groups following the German and French psychopathological tradition, where the incidence is dependent on the underlying complaint. 50% of the patients suffered from chronic psychoorganic disorders (34% organic personality disorders, 16% dementia). 9% suffered from an acute psychosis caused by complications and founded on substantial physical illness. 3 patients showed symptoms of a (under given circumstances) hitherto unknown endoform psychosis. In 9% of the patients, psychoreactive disturbances (anxiety and reactive depression) were observed. Two infants had congenital development deficiencies. 25% of the patients were without any psychopathology. Patients showing organic personality disorders mostly resemble each other to such a degree as to form a separate group. We suggest to name this group according to the most prominent psychopathology as "AIDS-lethargy". This status is characterised by a specific apathy, tiredness and indolence of the patients combined with the lack of emotional participation related to their own destiny. AIDS-lethargy is the first manifestation in appearance of the HIV infection of the brain itself. Another sequel of the brain infection is AIDS dementia which can be classified as "subcortical dementia" and differs from the more current forms of dementia clinically. Affected are mainly neuropsychologic functions like arousal, attention, mood and motivation, whereas the hallmarks of cortical involvement-aphasia, agnosia and apraxia-are not present. Supplementary findings (EEG, CCT, CSF): The group of patients with chronic psychoorganic disorders differs significantly from the group with psychoreactive disorders and normals. Pathological EEG and CCT are more frequent in psychoorganic disorders. CSF-test-including the intrathecally synthesized antibodies against HIV-does not show traceable variation in either group. There are four problems which may be combined in a given acute psychopathological HIV-syndrome: 1. Being member of a risk group with its reactive, psychosocial and personality problems. 2. Individual mental and emotional reaction to the fact of infection 3. Chronic psychoorganic disturbances. 4. Acute organic psychoses as a result of complications and other physical illness.

AB We examined serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 16 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 28 patients with vascular dementia (VD), their age-matched controls and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in order to evaluate the humoral immune response within the central nervous system both quantitatively and qualitatively. Intra-blood-brain barrier (BBB) protein synthesis was calculated by CSF IgG index. The presence of oligoclonal banding (OCB) was investigated with agarose isoelectric focusing (IEF) followed by immunoblotting with antihuman IgG. No patient with AD and only 4 patients with VD had slightly elevated IgG indexes, and no statistically significant differences in the indexes were found between the two groups. No bands were found in the CSF of AD patients but 3 VD patients had OCB in both serum and CSF. One VD patient had bands in serum but no bands in CSF. No kappa or lambda free light chains were found in those demented patients with demonstrable bands in the CSF and serum. No OCB were found in control sera and CSF. For comparison, the majority of patients with MS had OCB in CSF. Thus, no consistent increase of intrathecal protein synthesis was found in patients with AD and VD. Methodological differences explain at least part of the conflicting results published earlier.

AB Scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF) are disease-specific markers for the unconventional agent-induced, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum to SAF protein was reacted with brain sections from scrapie-infected mice, two familial cases of transmissible dementia, and three cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specific immunostaining of cerebral amyloid plaques occurred in the scrapie-infected mice and in the two familial cases of transmissible dementia. No immunoreactivity was detected in senile plaques or neurofibrillary tangles in the three cases of AD. Our results suggest that SAF, the causative pathogenic agent, and extracellular deposits of amyloid in the brain are closely related. Immunohistochemical detection of SAF protein could serve as a useful diagnostic adjunct in the postmortem evaluation of difficult cases of dementia. The identification of SAF protein in the brains of two affected members of a family combining the clinical and pathological features of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and the Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome (GSS) substantiates earlier conclusions of a nosological relationship between the two. Our study provides further evidence of the similarity of SAF protein to prion protein (PrP 27-30).

AB The CD4 molecule was originally described as a marker for a subset of lymphocytes; however, recent work has shown that a similar, if not identical, molecule is present on human brain. We have realized that this cell-surface recognition molecule is normally modulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), one of the 50 or more neuropeptides that compose a shared intercellular network joining the brain, glands, and immune system. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the etiological agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), has been found to mimic VIP binding via peptide T (4-8), a pentapeptide sequence present in approximately the same region of all 20 HIV isolates whose sequences are currently known. AIDS dementia results from interference of gp120, present on the HIV envelope protein, with normal VIP-ergic neurotrophic effects, and effects on cerebral blood flow.

AB Retrospective studies of hospitalized patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) have indicated that dementia occur in the majority of cases. In order to study the occurrence of dementia among AIDS patients, we conducted a controlled study of 16 unselected cases with a battery of neuropsychological tests known to be sensitive to brain damage of various etiologies. Except for fatigue, mental complaints and neuropsychiatric signs of dementia were generally sparse. As a group, the AIDS patients' performance in the neuropsychological tests did not differ from that of matched, healthy controls. Based on analyses of individual test results only one patient performed significantly inferior to what should be expected. The diagnosis of dementia should not be ascribed to AIDS victims on account of non-specific psycho-behavioral deviations that may represent a normal psychologic reaction to the disease, extreme fatigue, or both. Further, frequency measures of dementia in AIDS, based on large, unselected groups and with sufficient control, are still lacking. However, our study indicates that dementia is a less frequent complication of AIDS than so far assumed.

AB Four out of ten acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients develop neurologic complications. Because of the complex nervous system dysfunction experienced by these patients, neuroscience nurses face an extraordinary challenge. To provide care for patients with neurological complications of AIDS, the neuroscience nurse must understand the nature of the disease and its effects on the central nervous system. With this broad knowledge base, effective nursing interventions can be implemented.

AB Neurofibrillary tangles occur in a number of apparently distinct neurodegenerative diseases and in normal aging of the human brain. Antibodies raised against Alzheimer's disease paired helical filaments immunolabel the tangles seen in all other tangle-associated disorders examined to date. The neuronal microtubule-associated protein, tau, has recently been identified as an antigenic component of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaque neurites in Alzheimer's disease. Three different polyclonal antibodies with strong tau immunoreactivity are examined in this study. These antibodies were found to immunostain tangles in normal aged brain and in brains affected by a range of neurodegenerative disorders, including Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease plus Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and the parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam, as well as Pick bodies in Pick's disease. The findings further illustrate the relative nonspecificity of neurofibrillary lesions in neurodegenerative disorders.

AB The purpose of this study was to design a method by which immunoperoxidase staining can be applied to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections to demonstrate amyloid deposits in cerebral and systemic amyloidotic tissues. We used anti-prion protein, anti-beta-protein, anti-amyloid A, and anti-prealbumin antisera. The tissue sections were first treated with 100% formic acid for 5, 20, or 60 minutes and the unlabeled immunoperoxidase method (biotin-streptavidin system reagents) was used. This formic acid pretreatment enhanced immunoreactivity of the amyloid deposits which reacted positively with specific antiserum. The specificity of the immunostainings was well preserved. This method can also be used to demonstrate interspecies cross-reactivity, by using anti-human amyloid A and anti-scrapie hamster prion protein antisera, which stained negatively or faintly with amyloid deposits of heterogenous species. The technique is expected to reveal the buried epitopes of amyloid deposits in tissue sections.

AB Human immunodeficiency virus infection was identified immunohistochemically in the brains of 8 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome dementia complex. Using a monoclonal antibody against a structural viral protein (p25), infection was detected in white matter and basal ganglia in a distribution paralleling that of the major neuropathological abnormalities. Viral antigen was identified principally in perivascular and parenchymal macrophages and in multinucleated cells of macrophage origin that were identified morphologically and by immunocytochemical staining for acid phosphatase isozyme. In 4 of the 8 patients, viral antigen was also detected in acid-phosphatase-negative, process-bearing neuroglial cells; in 2 patients, antigen was detected in basal ganglion cells that were morphologically consistent with neurons and in alkaline-phosphatase-positive cells with elongated nuclei that were most likely of endothelial origin.

AB Subacute encephalitis, characterized by demyelination, gliosis of the gray and white matter, focal necrosis, microglial nodules, atypical oligodendrocyte nuclei, and multinucleation of cells, was present in 27 of 30 (90%) autopsied patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex. Subacute encephalitis was mainly distributed in the frontal (58%) and temporal (69%) lobes, basal ganglia (77%), amygdala (80%), and hippocampus (64%). Ten (37%) with moderate or severe subacute encephalitis were demented; 82% with mild subacute encephalitis had no recognized neurologic disorder. Human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) was isolated from neural tissue or CSF in 11 of 13 patients, 10 with subacute encephalitis, and 1 without CNS lesions. We conclude that subacute encephalitis is common in AIDS patients and is most likely caused by CNS infection with HTLV-III.

AB Several groups of senile dementias with differing causes and neurohistological substrates can be distinguished. Genetically determined Pick's disease produces severe neuronal atrophy; Alzheimer's disease is characterized by pathological neurofibrillary changes. Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease are slow virus diseases induced by unconventional agents. These diseases, after an incubation time of several years, take the course of slowly progressive degenerative diseases of the central nervous system without inflammatory and specific immune reactions of the host organism. Regarding pathogenesis these diseases were interpreted as degenerative processes as long as their transmissibility was yet unknown. The fact that so-called slow virus diseases can also produce argyrophilic plaques is a further common feature of this group of diseases and human pathological aging processes. So far, however, there is no proof that Alzheimer's disease is caused by an unconventional agent. On the other hand, common features of the products of aging changes and of unconventional viral diseases are apparent. In this paper current knowledge of pathogenetic mechanisms in this rapidly developing field of research is presented. Some relevant factors of organic dementia are discussed: special characteristics of neuronal atrophy (functional role of dendrites); architectonics of cerebral atrophy (laminar versus modular atrophy); neurotransmitter changes (causes or sequels of dementia) and a possibly non-specific origin of senile plaques. Finally, the clinical relevance of neurobiological research into dementias is emphasized.

AB A procedure for improving the specificity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) was devised, based on addition of antigen-specific or non-immune immunoglobulins to the citrated plasma sample and defining the difference in assay response between these two mixtures as the antigen-specific part of the response. When applied to measurement of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA; EC 3.4.21.31) antigen in plasma, this procedure resulted in elimination of the overestimates obtained in a large proportion (10-20%) of patients' samples when assayed according to the conventional ELISA technique. Basal t-PA concentrations in plasma were found to be highly age-dependent, normal values being about 3 micrograms/L for adults near 30 years of age and about 10 micrograms/L for those over 60. Patients with gallbladder stone disease had increased mass concentrations of t-PA in plasma, even when corrected for the age effect; patients with multi-infarct dementia did not.

AB One of the common neurological complications in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a subacute encephalopathy with progressive dementia. By using the techniques of cocultivation for virus isolation, in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy, the identity of an important cell type that supports replication of the AIDS retrovirus in brain tissue was determined in two affected individuals. These cells were mononucleated and multinucleated macrophages that actively synthesized viral RNA and produced progeny virions in the brains of the patients. Infected brain macrophages may serve as a reservoir for virus and as a vehicle for viral dissemination in the infected host.

AB Of 70 autopsied patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), 46 suffered progressive dementia that was frequently accompanied by motor and behavioral dysfunction. Impaired memory and concentration with psychomotor slowing represented the most common early presentation of this disorder, but in nearly one half of the patients either motor or behavioral changes predominated. Early motor deficits commonly included ataxia, leg weakness, tremor, and loss of fine-motor coordination, while behavioral disturbances were manifested most commonly as apathy or withdrawal, but occasionally as a frank organic psychosis. The course of the disease was steadily progressive in most patients, and at times was punctuated by an abrupt acceleration. However, in 20% of patients a more protracted indolent course was observed. In the most advanced stage of this disease, patients exhibited a stereotyped picture of severe dementia, mutism, incontinence, paraplegia, and in some cases, myoclonus. The high incidence and unique clinical presentation of this AIDS dementia complex is consistent with the emerging concept that this complication is due to direct brain infection by the retrovirus that causes AIDS.

AB In order to define the histopathological substrate of the dementia that frequently complicates the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), we analyzed the neuropathological findings in 70 autopsied adult AIDS patients, 46 of whom had suffered clinically overt dementia. Less than 10% of the brains were histologically normal. Abnormalities were found predominantly in the white matter and in subcortical structures, with relative sparing of the cortex. Their frequency and severity generally correlated well with the degree and duration of clinical dementia. Most commonly noted was diffuse pallor in the white matter, which in the pathologically milder cases was accompanied by scanty perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes and brown-pigmented macrophages, and in the most advanced cases by clusters of foamy macrophages and multinucleated cells associated with multifocal rarefaction of the white matter. However, in nearly one third of the demented cases the histopathological findings were remarkably bland in relation to the severity of clinical dysfunction. In addition, similar mild changes were noted in over one half of the nondemented patients, consistent with subclinical involvement. Vacuolar myelopathy was found in 23 patients and was generally more common and severe in patients with advanced brain pathology. Evidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was noted in nearly one quarter of the brains and was associated with a relative abundance of microglial nodules, but correlated neither with the major subcortical neuropathology nor with the clinical dementia, indicating that CMV infection likely represented a second, superimposed process. This study establishes the AIDS dementia complex as a distinct clinical and pathological entity and, together with accumulating virological evidence, suggests that it is caused by direct LAV/HTLV-III brain infection.

Acting out behavior, seen in the present case, may also be mistaken as a symptom of sociopathy.

AB A technique whereby immune complexes (ICs) are detected in the CSF and serum from their inhibitory effect on the agglutination of IgG-coated latex particles by rheumatoid factor (RF) has been applied to patients with the following neurological diseases: multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory diseases, extradural peripheral neuropathies (EPN), CNS tumors, dementia, and a control group of other neurological diseases (OND). The groups did not differ significantly in respect of IC positivity either in CSF or serum. The MS group was tested for correlations between percentage of IC positives and CSF IgG/Albumin ratio on the one hand and presence of oligoclonal bands on isoelectric focusing on the other. The specificity of ICs to the dysimmune condition is discussed.

AB A review of the literature suggests that an intracellular zinc deficiency may be the primary cause of the aging process. Zinc-metalloenzymes play an important role in many aspects of cellular metabolism including DNA replication, repair and transcription. The main enzymes affected by zinc deficiency may be specific for each cell type. Depending on which zinc enzymes are "overvulnerable", zinc deficiency may result in accumulation of useless (or toxic) materials, malproduction of essential proteins, a neoplastic change or cell death, thus explaining the variability in aging patterns in different cell types. There is no simple and reliable index of zinc status in humans and a therapeutic trial may be needed to establish zinc deficiency. Finding a zinc-compound which can enter the cell and avoid the development of intracellular zinc deficiency may retard the aging process and postpone age-related diseases.

AB The study population consisted of 1010 in patients and 81 control subjects. Patients suffering from schizophrenia, cerebral atrophy of unknown origin, dementia, depression, mental retardation, and ethanol-induced brain deterioration (alcoholics) were skin tested with 25 micrograms of S-100 protein and neuron-specific enolase isolated from fresh human brain. Evaluation of delayed skin hypersensitivity reactions at 24 hr revealed a high incidence of positive responses to S-100 protein: heavy alcoholism, 96.8%; depression, 94.1%; cerebral atrophy, 92.6%; dementia, 91.2%; schizophrenia, 87.7%; and mental retardation, 69.4%. The incidence of positive reactions to neuron-specific enolase in schizophrenics was 91.6%. Of 58 control subjects tested with S-100 protein, 6.8% were positive, whereas of 23 normal individuals tested with neuron-specific enolase, 6.4% developed mild skin reactions. These data suggest a close relationship between delayed hypersensitivity to neural tissue antigens and immunopsychiatric diseases, and they imply that cell-mediated immune mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of certain mental disorders.

AB Serum antibody titres to eight neurotropic viruses were measured by enzyme immunoassay in 450 psychiatric in-patients and 143 controls. A seasonal variation in schizophrenic births was observed, with a peak incidence between March and April. Both herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus antibody titres correlated with age and, when this was controlled for, no significant differences emerged between any patient group and the controls. Mumps antibody titres were significantly lower in patients with mental subnormal and neurosis or personality disorder; measles and rubella antibody titres were lower in male but not female mentally handicapped patients; males had lower antibody titres to mumps, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus than females in all groups. A decrease in mumps antibody titres was also found in schizophrenics if the medication factor was excluded. These low antibody titres may indicate an impaired immune response. Thus perinatal or childhood subclinical viral infections of the central nervous system, particularly of mumps, might lead to a range of possible psychiatric outcomes in later life.

AB Unexplained debilitating dementia or encephalopathy occurs frequently in adults and children with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Brains from 15 individuals with AIDS and encephalopathy were examined by Southern analysis and in situ hybridization for the presence of human T-cell leukemia (lymphotropic) virus type III (HTLV-III), the virus believed to be the causative agent of AIDS. HTLV-III DNA was detected in the brains of five patients, and viral-specific RNA was detected in four of these. In view of these findings and the recent demonstration of morphologic and genetic relatedness between HTLV-III and visna virus, a lentivirus that causes a chronic degenerative neurologic disease in sheep, HTLV-III should be evaluated further as a possible cause of AIDS encephalopathy.

AB The authors observed one case of myoclonic dementia reversible with steroid therapy, associated with Grave's disease and Sjogren's syndrome. A circulating IgG fraction was demonstrated reacting specifically with cerebral micro-vessels and which evolved in parallel with the neuro-psychiatric disturbances. These results support the hypothesis of an autoimmune vasculitis causing the dementia. The persistence of abnormalities one year after clinical cure showing an alteration of the blood-brain barrier associated with the appearance of circulating antibodies against the hypophyseal cells, and in view of the predictive value of these antibodies, suggests a possibility of the eventual apparition of an Alzheimer type dementia.

AB Frontal and occipital lobes were taken within four hours of death from four senile patients (77-94 years) and frozen at -70 degrees C. After thawing at room temperature, gray and white matter were separated and subjected to sequential elution at pH 7.4 and pH 2.5. The eluates were processed for isoelectric focusing on 2.5% polyacrylamide gels and stained with silver nitrate; immunoblotting was done on agarose gels and stained by immunoperoxidase for IgG and light chains. Quantitation of the amount of IgG present in neutral and acidic eluates was performed by immunonephelometry and ELISA. Only the neutral eluates contained significant amounts of IgG, which were usually polyclonal. These data indicate that IgG associated with senile cerebral amyloid are not bound to any brain or vascular component and the data do not support the occurrence of an intraparenchymal immune response.

AB We report the transmission of HLA haplotypes and Gm allotypes in 97 members of a single kindred containing 257 individuals, 45 of whom were determined by clinical examination, autopsy, or historical data to have had Alzheimer disease (AD). Extensive inbreeding suggests that more than one gene may contribute to susceptibility to AD in this family, despite the apparent vertical transmission of illness. The distribution of HLA haplotypes and of Gm allotypes to affected and unaffected siblings is consistent with the possibility that genes in the HLA region of chromosome 6 and perhaps also in the Gm region of chromosome 14 are determinants of susceptibility. Further studies are needed to investigate whether susceptibility to AD may result from an interaction between (immune response?) genes on these two chromosomes.

AB Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is a newly described, highly virulent, idiopathic syndrome characterized by lymphocyte dysfunction, multiple opportunistic infections and lymphoma, which primarily affects previously healthy, promiscuous homosexual males. Dementia and delirium due to infection and/or disseminated lymphoma may frequently occur in these patients, especially as the illness progresses. Consulting and liaison psychiatrists must be particularly alert to the possibility of organicity in these patients, in addition to the psychological distress caused by the AIDS syndrome itself.

AB The most crucial unanswered question in Parkinson's disease is its fundamental cause. Since Carlsson's original suggestion that dopamine may be a transmitter in the central nervous system involved in the control of motor function and that it may be involved in the Parkinsonian syndrome (Carlsson, 1959), and the now-classic paper by Ehringer and Hornykiewicz (1960) which definitively showed the significant reduction of dopamine concentration in the neostriatum of cases of idiopathic Parkinson and postencephalitic parkinsonism, the vast amount of work on the subject has focused on the biochemical and pharmacologic correlates of this dopaminergic system failure involving particularly the nigrostriatal pathways. The concept of a specific neurotransmitter deficiency associated with a specific neurological syndrome potentially amenable to replacement therapy, has appropriately generated a considerable degree of clinical and research interest for over 20 years, but, with few exceptions, there has been hardly any focused or concerted research effort on looking at direct causal factors or primary initiating events in this disease process. As in Alzheimer's disease, another of the degenerative diseases of the brain of unknown origin with a specific biochemical substrate, any etiologic hypothesis for Parkinson's disease--whether a virus, an age-related immune system dysfunction, a genetic factor, a "trophic" substance, or a toxin--would have to explain the selective involvement of specific transmitter-defined neuronal pathways, the non-specificity of the brain lesions that define the disease, and the clinical involvement of a sizeable segment of the aging population. Of the several plausible hypotheses mentioned earlier, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive, we would like to critically consider the possibility of a viral cause.

AB To confirm and extend previous observations concerning the correlation between cell-mediated immunity and psychiatric diseases, 511 patients with schizophrenia, cerebral atrophy, dementia, and mental retardation, and 32 control subjects and 27 control patients were skin-tested with human brain S-100 protein and human liver protein: 70.2-93.1% of tested psychiatric patients developed positive skin hypersensitivity reactions to S-100 protein, while 2.8-20.7% of patients reacted to liver protein. Of control subjects, 6.2-7.4% responded to S-100 protein, and 7.4-9.4% to liver protein. The findings indicate that cell-mediated immune processes may be involved in brain mechanisms underlying cerebral atrophy, depression, dementia, schizophrenia, and mental retardation.

AB Three lesions that characterize the nosologic findings in the brain of Alzheimer's presenile dementia and senile dementia of Alzheimer type, ie, neuritic plaque, neurofibrillary tangle, and microangiopathy, all are frequently associated with amyloid deposition. There has been some question, however, as to whether these lesions share the same etiology. Moreover, the specific chemical nature of amyloid associated with these lesions has not yet been determined. In the present study, formalin-fixed paraffin sections of the affected brains were tested immunocytochemically for their reactivity against antiserum to prealbumin (recently disclosed as the major constituent of amyloid associated with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy as well as senile cardiac amyloid) and known components of other types of amyloid (AA, AP, etc.). The results demonstrated that amyloid deposits in all three lesions reacted with anti-prealbumin, suggesting that it is a common constituent of these lesions. Indeed, it is likely that prealbumin is the major constituent of amyloid associated with neuritic plaque, neurofibrillary tangle, and microangiopathy.

AB This review has been directed towards those aspects of DS which bear upon pathological aging. Clinical dementia in DS has heretofore been studied largely by retrospective methods with variable findings. A prospective study utilizing techniques designed to measure cognitive performance in a poorly verbal, retarded population is badly needed. There is definitive evidence for Alzheimer's disease changes in the brains of DS patients with some suggestion of altered topography compared to the general population. Immunological studies have established a T-cell deficiency in DS that may be linked to precocious aging of thymic-dependent processes. Both antiviral and nonantiviral effects of interferon are accentuated in cell culture systems utilizing DS tissue, presumably as a consequence of the localization of the interferon gene(s) on chromosome 21. Multiple endocrine studies confirm the high frequency of autoimmune disease, an abnormality that may be related to the problems of immune surveillance in DS. Precocious aging has been noted in regards to measures of skin elasticity, fenestration of cardiac valves, and premature cataracts. The 21st chromosome has been implicated in the elevated activity of superoxide dismutase, a finding of significance in regard to potential intracellular damage from increased levels of peroxide. Several studies have suggested a compensatory increase in glutathione peroxidase.

AB Aging is the progressive accumulation of changes with time associated with and/or responsible for the ever-increasing susceptibility to disease and death. These time-related changes are attributed to the aging process. This process may be due in part to free radical reactions, largely those involving oxygen, going on continuously throughout the cells and tissues. Dietary manipulations expected to lower the rate of production of free-radical reaction damage have been shown to 1) increase the life span of mice, rats, fruit flies, nematodes, and rotifers, as well as the life span of neurospora, 2) inhibit development of some forms of cancer, 3) enhance humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, and 4) slow development of amyloidosis and the autoimmune disorders of NZB mice. Free-radical reactions may also play a significant role in the deterioration of the cardiovascular and central nervous systems with age. It is reasonable to expect, on the basis of present data, that the healthy life span can be increased by five or more years by keeping body weight down, at a level compatible with a sense of well-being, while ingesting diets adequate in essential nutrients but designed to minimize random free-radical reactions in the body.

The relatives exhibited an excess of dementing illness consistent with genetic transmission. Risk to relatives decreased sharply as severity of the proband's illness decreased. Also, when compared with a control group and the general population, the relatives had excesses of Down's syndrome, lymphoma, and immune diatheses. These associated conditions also were more likely to be present when the proband had severe illness. Mortality at all ages was increased among the relatives.

AB Among Guamanian natives, serum IgA and IgG levels were found to be higher than normal in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); serum IgA was higher and IgM lower than normal in parkinsonism-dementia (PD). IgA levels increased with age in ALS, PD, and normal subjects; IgG increased with age in ALS and IgM decreased with age in PD. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels did not correlate with the duration of either disease. Immunodeficient ALS and PD patients had higher IgM and lower IgA levels than the other ALS and PD patients. Neither differences in viral antibody titers nor the presence of autoantibodies or circulating immune complexes could account for the variations in serum Ig levels between patients and controls. We conclude that differences in serum Ig levels in ALS and PD patients are probably due to repeated infections and abnormal immunoregulation accompanying immunodeficiency during the course of ALS and PD, rather than to a specific antiviral or autoimmune response.

AB Cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) or sera or both from 57 chronic schizophrenics and 18 senile demented patients were examined by various tests for HBsAg. both CSF and serum were positive in 2 schizophrenics while in six HBsAg was detected in the CSF only. Elevated values of circulating immune complexes were found in positive patients. Most CSF positive for HBsAg also contained neutralizing antibodies to Herpesvirus hominis type 1. Ultramicroscopic structures similar to hepatitis B virus (HBV) components and herpesviral particles were visualized in the CSF of one patient on electron microscope (EM) grids coated with anti-human IgG serum. Most HBsAg positive patients appeared to be liver-symptoms-free carriers. In the CSF of a 79 years old senile demented man HBsAg was proved serologically. Several herpesviral particles complexed with globular material and spherical structures for 15 to 25 nm in diameter were visualized in the same CSF on EM grids coated with anti-human IgG serum. The findings support the importance of herpesviruses in mental illness. Penetration of HBsAg through the blood-brian barrier might be involved as an iatrogenic factor in the course of late psychoses.

AB The molecular nature of neurofibrillary tangles of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was studied by immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence techniques. Five antiserums, including anti-humanbrain-2-cycle-purified-microtubule-fractions (2 x MT), anti-calf-brain-2 x MT, anti-sea-urchin-egg-tubulin, antibeef-brain-tubulin, and anti-human-brain-neurofilament(NF)-210-kilodalton(kd)-protein were tested for their binding to neurofibrillary tangles. The antihuman-2 x MT serum stained structures resembling neurofibrillary tangles, neurites of neuritic plaques, and microglialike cells in SDAT brains, but no such staining pattern was detected in normal brain sections. In neurons isolated from SDAT brains, about 40% of the tangles were labeled by the anti-human-2xMT serum with an identical pattern. Other antiserums tested did not preferentially bind tanglelike structures in tissue sections and bound to less than 5% of the tangles in isolated neurons. These results suggest that the antigenic sites of tubulin and NF proteins are not shared by neurofibrillary tangles. Different from the calf preparation, the human-2 x MT fractions contained a prominent protein band that was identical to ferritin in molecular weight and cross-reacted with anti-human-2 x MT and anti-human-ferritin serums. However, antiserums to this ferritinlike protein, or anti-ferritin, did not stain neurofibrillary tangles. Although neither the calf 2 x MT nor two other human MT fractions failed to elicit an antiserum that stained tangles, these fractions were able to remove the antihuman-2 x MT serum activity that binds to tangles. The data suggest that the protein (or proteins) that makes up neurofibrillary tangles of SDAT is present in various quantities in microtubule fractions of normal brain.

AB A cytochemical study of 14 cases of adult dementia revealed the presence of gamma globulin in the amyloid of three cases of congophilic angiopathy by means of immunofluorescence microscopy. In these cases, the additional identification of human albumin is regarded to indicate a non-specific macromolecular leak in the blood-brain barrier. Both reactions are inhibited by prior absorption with the appropriate serum protein. Twelve of the 14 cases had congophilic amyloid deposits which were not affected by permanganate pre-treatment, so that immunoglobulin content remains a possibility, despite the negative immune reaction. Alcianophilia was studied at a varying pH and electrolyte concentration, but these findings do not appear to have nosologic significance. The three positive cases are characterized by a rapid terminal decline. The heterogeneity of amyloid and the significance of immunoamyloid in the pathogenesis of adult dementia is discussed.

AB Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a protein that is associated with 9-nm filaments of astrocytes, was observed to be increased in the astrocytes surrounding senile plaques in patients with Alzheimer dementia and in aged subjects without dementia. A few GFAP-positive fibers were seen in the centers of plaques. These results emphasized the selectivity of senile changes; whereas some cells seemed to undergo degeneration or dysfunction, other cells--astrocytes--maintain their capacity for reaction and may increase the formation of at least one protein, GFAP.

AB The historical events in the evolution of Alzheimer's disease are reviewed, including the initial description by Alois Alzheimer and the subsequent controversy regarding the nosological specificity of this entity. The similarity of senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease is emphasized. The basis for the modern concept of Alzheimer's disease as premature or accelerated aging is included in the review. The pathological correlates of the major categories of adult dementia have been described. The traditional criteria of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques have been re-evaluated using the current insight into these changes afforded by electron microscopy and biochemistry. The significance of amyloid has been described because it occurs within the senile plaque and also as the essential component of congophilic angiopathy. The new information regarding neuronal cell counts and the loss of choline acetyltransferase has been evaluated in terms of an indication of a pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease. The current understanding of normal pressure hydrocephalus, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and multi-infarct dementia has been described. Brain biopsy in dementia has been described as having diagnostic, research, pathogenic, and prognostic value. The precautions involving the performance and handling of the biopsy have been stressed, particularly because these procedures involve conditions of possible slow virus etiology. The polemic for Alzheimer's disease as aging or slow virus infection has been summarized. At this time a consideration seems justified that Alzheimer's disease is an age-related, slow virus disease due to a hitherto unknown immune defect. Aging as an etiological agent must be clarified before Alzheimer's disease, in any form, can be considered to be an inevitable consequence of longevity.

AB Antiserum against normal human neurotubules purified by in-vitro assembly precipitated both neurotubules and a polypeptide isolated from Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles in Ouchterlony double-diffusion tests. The antiserum specifically labelled neurofibrillary tangles, in isolated neurons by immunofluorescence and in tissue sections by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique. These results indicate that neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease probably originate from neurotubules.

AB The most common cause of senile dementia appears to be a pathological process indistinguishable from that found in presenile dementia of the Alzheimer type. Consideration of the neuropathological changes suggest that this disease may involve in interaction of at least three processes: a viral-like infection, a disorder in the immune system and the neurotoxic effect of an environmental agent. The evidence in support of this hypothesis is reviewed.

AB A study into the relationship of immune change in the serum and the presence of senile dementia is reported. Three groups were studied, senile dementia, cerebrovascular disease and subjects without evidence of brain disease. All were aged 65 years and over. The immunofluorescent studies showed an excess of antineuronal reactivity and a fall in antinuclear antibody in females with senile dementia. There was no significant difference between the groups in respect of immunoglobulins, slide latex and a complement fixation test, against a variety of tissues. The significance of the findings in relation to other published results is discussed.
